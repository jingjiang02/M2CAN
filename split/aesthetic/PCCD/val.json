Because of the static nature of the image there is very little dynamic tension here.  But since it has the look of an animal portrait that lack of dynamism is not so much a limiting factor.  The background environment in which you shot the deer presents a minor issue in regards to the relative clarity of the subject.  All the competing twigs, branches, leaves and patterns behind the deer, tend to create complex patterns in which the deer is obscured and therefore less prominent to the eye.

Harsher sidelight would have caused even more background complexity and thus lack of an apparent point of focus for your subject. I also like the muted yet compelling colors in the composition.

Animals in the wild are always interesting subjects to capture because they are, no matter how rare or plentiful they may be, are always a surprise to us when we find them in their natural state.

Your aperture setting of  F/8 is probably pretty much a sweet spot for ensuring good clarity in the image throughout the focal plane.  Therein lies an issue. A larger aperture setting would have allowed you to possibly put the background detail in softer relief and thus 'pop' out your main subject a bit more.  Having said this I'll also acknowledge that it appears you were shooting in lighting conditions that may have been overcast or cloudy (judging from the lack of contrast and shadow detail and it being 5:00 in the afternoon).  So in order to get your background sufficiently soft you would probably had to shoot at an aperture much wider and consequently requiring a shutter speed that was very slow, say three or four stops slower, say at perhaps 1/60.  Unless you were using a tripod and your subject was standing fairly still, you might have had difficulty here.

Although this was a morning shot it is not particularly or overly saturated or contrasty as often happens. There is some minor and subtle highlight clipping on the leftmost lower portion of the rock stack in the foreground.  The shadows of the rocks in the background do not look as dark as one would expect them to look and appear to be a bit faded.  This takes away a bit from the dynamic range of the image and tends to flatten the details overall as well as the dramatic impact that you would have with darker shadows.

But for me its just sort of a ho-hum subject.  Cairns are interesting.  But usually they are more interesting on the trail than they are as a photo.  I think that the little piles of rocks, usually made by hikers to pass the time of day, or in some cases to mark a trail (usually in more remote and less frequented areas of nature)don't lend themselves well to a photograph that draws you in or holds your interest.  There isn't a lot about these particular little stackings that makes you want to either be there, or cause you to wonder how they came to be.

The way this turtle is close to the sea bed and the water level is great. You really caught a wonderful photogenic opportunity.", "Regarding composition and perspective I really don't have much to say, it's done in a very classical way, and the classical works every time. It's a good use of the rule of thirds for composition, wile having the frame divided in four in the same time. This is also a pretty valid point of view, though I would like to see the full turtle on a wider frame, and I'm guessing you have some more of that. And maybe, just maybe, you have reframed the picture on a digital post-processing crop. Not saying you shouldn't because if you did you did it well, it works. But the horizontal line could be leveled, it would compliment the perfection of the classical approach.I love the depth of field here. Usually a deep field it's hard to make work unless you're capturing a seamless landscape, blurring the background is a good way of making sure you won't have any unwanted distractions from your subject. Obviously you don't have any problem with your subject, as we only notice the fish, the four fish it seems in the somewhat near background, a few seconds after having recognized the full features of the turtle. This might also be due to a problem we'll discuss ahead.This is almost a high key photograph due to the dominance of light over shadow, but miss interpret what I'm saying, it really works. And it would be very hard to do it otherwise because this see bed is white sand and you clearly have a clean and strong day light working for you. I can't really say it's day light, nor I can vouch this is any sea bed. I could be a very sophisticated aquarium (the perspective of what we have here is quite enclosed, it doesn't need to have been done in a wide space like the sea) and the light, for the water to be crisp clear, could be artificial, some kind of neon maybe... But I'm going for the real thing, in the sea, perhaps in a known site for it's sea wild life. It could be the Galapagos.", "This is where you have a problem. The colors are pretty pale, but this is also due to the lack of contrast, again easily solve in good software. What you can't solve in good software is the lack of information on the original file. This version here in Guru Shots has very few chances of getting much better... Can this camera save images in RAW files? That would be the way to go for this situation, giving you the chance for improving the colors. Correcting the white balance just isn't enough, at least in this small version saved for web to be shown here.The lighting is very nice! I would rate it higher if the colors weren't so pale. You have the main light coming from right at a low angle suggesting this is early on the day of late in the afternoon. It's very good light for texture and depth, and you got a very good angle on the shadowed side. Plus, the white sand sea bed makes the perfect reflector to fill in all the shadows. This is what makes this shot a good candidate for a high key. I love backlit subjects! It's strong and dramatic. ", "It's always good to do something different and underwater photography is, again, always a good way to go. On top of that your subject is quite interesting. I guess we feel some kind of metaphysical reassurance with reflections on water, and even more when the reflection is on top. There is something about symmetry and perfection that I could never put my head on entirely. We're just from from Renaissance, didn't really moved from that age, we're still there. Plus, the turtle is coming right at us in a way that we inevitably fall into your position during the making of this photograph. It's good \"wild life\" documentary work with a touch of artistic sensibility. Well done!It's great the way the turtle is crossing the mirror barrier with it's head, making wave patterns that reflect it's colors very nicely.", "The depth of field is good, as said before, but we don't really have a far away field to be worried about it. It's just good that we can see those fish in the background helping make this picture the good document of real wild life that it is. My only reservation is due to the fact that this might simply not be the photographers decision. We never know with these do everything compact cameras.", "The focus is right on the spot, as it seams to be in the this very small version of your photograph, but you also have a big depth of field, so it's natural that the eyes are in perfect focus. This is the good side of working with minimal aperture, your depth of field gets to be so big that you don't really have to worry with getting the perfect focus.I have never used your camera, so I don't know what kind of controls you have, or the degree of control, but I guess you can't control much... and this is a factory setting for best results. So, I'm giving you 7 because the focus is good, not knowing if you did it consciously. But one thing is certain, this is not your first photograph with this camera and you knowing what could come out of the shot must be taken into account. The camera might also have image stabilization and some kind of AF tracking system. Any way, you did a good job.", "All the advertisement I've seen and reviews I've read say this is the right camera for the job. Well, I have to agree in a way but this thing is: if you want to do great photography you must be in total control of your camera. And although a compact as this one is more than enough to do great pictures like this snap shot pf yours, there is nothing that compares to using a full featured SLR. But don't get me wrong, I'm thinking about getting one of these for me. The waterproof casings for most SLRs, or DSLRs are prohibitively expensive. It's a too big investment if you're not going to get any profits from it. Any way, if I could just now I would go for the waterproof casing form my Nikon D700, but I can't as is costs more than the camera, so this tough Olympus is a good choice, even if it is a consumer product. It may do the job. But than again, this is good for a kind of a photo diary as a complement to any more serious photography and you used it well.Regarding any of the possible controls of this camera I just don't know, so I'm going to say that this picture is a little over exposed, just a little, because it works like this, although it could be better. But this is something you can correct in any good photo editing software and the correction would be minimal. If your going for the high key is one thing and you should go all the way, making it even more white but taking care that highlights wouldn't loose their texture. The easy way would be to make it just a little darker.The color temperature also needs some work done. The shot is a bit greenish. Not that this is totally wrong, it isn't, but it could be much better if the white balance had been done for the green and cyan dominance in these waters. This, again, is very easy to solve in good software.The speed is fast as it should be to freeze the subject into a crisp and clear look(the way for this photograph to make an impression as it does) but there is nothing to say about this as the camera probably has most of it done from factory and you only have minor choices to do. This is a personal radical sports camera...The focal length you obviously can control, as today all compact cameras that are worthy of buying have a good zoom range and this one seems to have a very good wide-angle range.

Normally you want to lose the background into a blur and to do this you need a longer focal length of say 90mm. The exposure is acceptable as the main subjects' faces are evenly lit (but see comment below). White balance is ok but it's possible to warm up the light on subjects' faces by using the gold side of a reflector to reflect some golden light onto their faces. They are inexpensive to buy and fun to use. Shutter speed of 1/50th second is the minimum you should use for a focal length of 50mm. I think 1/100 would have been better unless the camera was on a tripod. It depends on how steady your hands are! Generally, the minimum shutter speed should match or be faster than the focal length you are using. For example, a focal length of 200mm requires a shutter speed of 1/200th second and so on.

There is a nice left to right virtual horizontal leading line on the right lower portion of the frame, formed by the stone walkway and it framing by the tables and chairs on either side of it. This brings the eye into the scene from the bottom of the frame quite well.  Other factors here are the people who not only form the 'story' based upon their unique positions, actions, movements and expressions.  In this case your image is rather static in that regard.

As such it presents as more of a flat tapestry like image than a three dimensional one.  This is not necessarily a negative and often images are best presented in this manner.  You have many interesting vertical lines formed by the plant stems, juxtaposed with the generally left to right placement of the flower tops.  This sort of arrangement forms a subtle visual grid rather than a fluid pathway into the image. Although the depth of field of your image suggests depth, it is countermanded by the leading lines in the image. I like that you took a position that put nothing but smooth gradient texture from a leaf, directly behind your flower head.  This sets it off nicely and doesn't allow any distracting forms to interfere with the nice edge lines of the blossom. I do like the imagery that is suggested of a cycle of a flower life by including three flowers in various stages of life, a bud on the far right, a fully blossoming flower in the center and to the far left a bare stalk with no petals.  I don't know whether you meant to do this, but if so good job.  I do think I would have liked to have seen a more ordered and symmetrical and less random placement of these stalks in the image.

I think you may wish to consider using aperture priority mode and then adjusting your  aperture settings to suit the situation (low light/bright light/shallow or deep depth of field/etc.  The flowers here have some color bloom and mottling at the petal edges which tells me either they were  over exposed at capture because the cameras metering saw all the dark background green and attempted to average it to a lighter tone overall, or that you have set your saturation settings in your camera to be on.

You main key light to the right of the subject is too bright and you have lost critical detail on the subjects skin. This is quite easy to do when dealing with subjects with very light skin tones so I would recommend the use of a light meter to check exposures before shooting. Most studio lights are too powerful to allow shooting at f1.8, unless you are using a strong Neutral Density Filter on the lens. If you do not have a light meter, then the next best thing would be to check the histogram on your camera.

The small Jack-O-Lantern though should have been placed so that it would have made it all the way into the frame, or else cropped out altogether. I am not sure what the large dark wooden crate behind the subject was for, and it should not be there as it adds nothing to the story, and detracts from the subject; your adorable son. So for me it was a distraction. ", "Overall you have a great shot of your son. There are several little things however that could be better when it comes to lighting. Though the camera clock says you took this at 325AM, I am sure that it was indeed probably late afternoon when the shot happened. The sun in the Autumn sky is at a low angle, which casts a long shadow, and the golden tones of the light indicate that it was getting close to the \"golden hour\" the hour before actual sunset.The problems I find are classic pitfalls often encountered when shooting out of doors. Take a look at your son's face, notice most of the bright lit falls to one side of your son's face. His nose in one place is \"blown out\" meaning that it is way overexposed and you no longer see his nose, but just a bright white spot where his nose should be. The same thing happens with his hand on that side of his body. In contrast the other side of his face is more in shadow, and you see a fall off of contrast.In addition, you have some interesting detail in that concrete wall behind your son, but those details are lost mostly due to the shadow in the background.The solution to this problem, would be the use of a light modifier, such as reflectors, like foil,or a hand shade to shield portions of the shot from too much light. In this particular case I would suggest shooting  him under the shade of something like a white bed sheet as a \"tent\" over him. This would do two things, soften the light and help to spread the light evenly over the frame in a more uniform pattern. Similar to shooting in a studio with a soft box. Shoot the photo using a larger aperture (smaller number, like f2.8), and shoot this at ISO 200-ISO 400, depending on your meter reading. This should cause the light to be more uniform, (no blown out areas), and the dark background would be more uniform with the fore ground. Experiment here is the key, as it all depends on the time of day, the amount of available light.   ", "It would be hard to top your subject here. What a cute young man!

I would suggest that you whenever possible, take some additional time and explore manual settings to fine tune your photo to make it all it can be.You get the shot, one that you can keep hang on the wall, or a photo book to remember him in the years ahead.

Below are some ideas you may wish to consider.  ", "I think that the composition could be a bit better here.  I think the direction of the gazes in the respective subjects in interesting as it is not traditional.  I like that the mom is looking at the daughter and she in turn has her attention directed towards, if not directly at, the camera or something outside the frame of action.  This creates a dissonance that can be both unnerving and at the same time compelling.  I think there is much too much empty space around the subjects and they are placed in the middle of the composition which appears a bit too static and not as dynamic as they could.  Centering them with all that space around them tends to reduce the intimacy that a more frame filled composition would have provided.  I also feel that you could have a little less space between the subjects in this composition to increase the intimacy of them in context. ", "I think the colors are overall pleasing in this image and there are no harsh nor distracting shadow areas either on the subjects faces, or the wall behind them. I'm not at all sure what your lighting set up was.  You indicate that you were using flash, but the lighting suggests a very diffuse flash, or fill lights as well.  At any rate I think the lighting, notwithstanding the exposure issue above, is pretty good and even.  ", "The subject matter of this image is a good one.  I like the less than static story that is implied in this image.  ", "", "The focus here looks good and sharp from the low resolution image provided.  ", "This image is very flat, dull and lacks contrast. A quick look at your image histogram will inform you that out of 255 tonal range points (00 being pure black, and 255 being pure white), your dynamic range of captured tones was significantly bi-furcated and limited to the midrange of available tones.  By this I mean that your camera did not capture the entire available tonal range of the image.  As a result your image is stacked up in the 3/4 to 2/4 midrange area with deep blacks and bright highlights missing.  This results in a dull and lackluster image.  This however can easily be remedied in post processing, assuming you have access to a post processing software program like Photoshop, or Aperture for Mac. I don't ever say that a particular exposure setting is wrong.  But there are some that are perhaps more 'right' than others. In this case the image is very flat and dull as pointed out above. I'm going to venture that your center weighted average mode you were using took a look at all the white space around your subjects and then attempted to average the entire scene at what amounted to a 50% gray value. Also since you were using flash, you could well have kept your ISO at a lower, and more noise free value of 100 or so. I think f/8 was a good choice as it allowed you to keep all the pertinent parts of the face and your subjects overall, in sharp relief.

Photography of such a subject is all about shooting hundreds of images and choosing the best.  You are of course restricted by the power of your lens (You do not state what lens you have used) but I would be looking at using something like a 400 or 500mm f2.8-f4 probably also with a 1.4 extender to get in close on the subject.

I'm going to guess it was just one of those times when you came across a shoot and made use of the models who were there.  I remember doing that once in San Diego, with less friendly results than you had.  :)  At any rate, here's a few thoughts. ", "There are compositional aspects to this that I think work well, and some that don't.  For instance I like the angle of the two mens bodies as they lean into each other and thus coalesce the viewers eye at an apex just above them.  This creates a visually pleasing, subtle triangular shape that begins at the bottom of the mens coats and comes to a peak at their heads. I also think the very slick, sharkskin look of their suits creates interesting silky smooth lines of texture in the image that work nicely with the soft folded lines of the columns behind them.  However cutting off he feet doesn't work well here as it creates an amputation sort of look that makes you want to pull both of them up out of the bottom of the frame.  Normally you don't really want to crop off the foot at the joint, or anyplace that leaves just part of a foot in view.  I think this would be a much better composition if the two men were interacting rather than panning for the camera. (Although I realize you were piggy-backing on another shoot and didn't have much say as to what the models were doing at any given time). Lastly I think that because the feet are clipped then the extra space above the subjects seems unbalanced and is somewhat exaggerated as a result.   ", "I like the muted very compatible colors in this image.  The dark gray suits really are complemented by the gray stone work in the background walls and floor.  Light is even on the subjects as well with no harsh shadows.  I think the image is a bit heavy to the mid tone range and slightly washed out as a result.  I think it could be popped a bit by simply adjusting your levels mid tone slider to darken them some.  ", "I think the subject here is fairly interesting.  It has the look of a fashion shoot image so I'm not sure under what circumstances however you would show or use this image or what specific applications you might find for it.

I like that you have attempted to provide a sense of symmetry and balance by lining up the boots by their relative height and that mechanism works okay.

The placement of the boots in the dead center of the composition I think draws the eye to them, but also lends a static and motionless sort of feel to the composition as well. Having one white pair among the other black ones provides nice contrast but I think the placement of the boots, both in juxtaposition with the group, and in the frame in general is less dynamic than an offset composition might be. I can see the curving road in the image and it provides a bit of leading line and s curve to the image but its power is diminished by the fact that the boots obscure most of the lines of the road, and thus the effect that it might have in leading the eye into the frame is substantially diminished. I think too that the background, though blurred, contains a lot of distracting detail that, for the sort of image you have taken that attempts to showcase the boots, tends to distract from the subject. I feel a bit woozy when I look at the image because it appears that you oriented your image to ensure that the boots were straight and as a result the natural horizon in the background is canted considerably.  This technique is not a bad thing but I don't think it works as well here as it would for say an edgy wedding photo of two people running on the beach and the image shot from ground up.

Perhaps a more oblique view of the playground near the corner of the structure may have created a sense of depth.

For instance the area around the bottom of the slide on the right side of the composition loses much of its detail from the blown out peripheral highlights bleeding around the edges of the fence and thus looks a little strange and distracting. Also I think that a judicious crop of the image to remove about an inch from both sides and approximately an inch and a half from the top of the sky area to reduce the white space would improve the composition and remove a lot of the distraction of too much white space.

I think the subject is a bit overwhelmed by the amount of white space in this image.  If you were making this a stock image for advertising that much white space might be useful for the addition of text, or compositing of other images onto or into the image itself.

Not being able to see the original photo, I'd only be guessing relative to the appropriateness of the aperture setting.

A vertical framing would be more difficult to capture this hawk if it flew to the right or left rather than straight at you.

The birdhouse provides a break in the scene. I have to mention that \"scaring up\" animals to get them to do something, can be detrimental to the animal (using energy it needs to find food and stay warm, creating stress) and to the person doing the \"scaring\" - some animals and some raptors can be very aggressive (especially in times of stress and during the breeding season) and interpret such actions as threats.

I suspect that since you were using a more general evaluative exposure setting that your camera saw the scene as brighter than normal due to all the bright snow and cloud area. As a result it averaged the scene and produced a rather flat toned image. Also I think your f/stop did not need to be so small as it has a tendency, particularly on long lenses, to soften the image due to diffraction.

You have used the rule of thirds which is a classic, but you have given prominence to the sky. Not that you can't have the river as a subject and use two thirds for the sky, you can get away with it if the conditions are favorable, but in this case they weren't. There was a to big distance between the exposure in the shadow and the high light in the sky. So much that for the water to be noticeable the sky had to be totally over exposed. To set this into balance taking some of the exposure from the sky revealing it's proper texture would darken the water so much this image would loose it's meaning and interest.Further more, if the framing had been done to give two thirds for the river, not only the problem with the sky would be minimized as much as we could get more action of the flowing water and it's curves around the stones. I must say you have chosen your subject beautifully but made a poor choice for the time of the day or the angle, I'm sure you could have a better light angle downstream, but than maybe the subject wouldn't be as interesting. Also, we have a little to much contrast, but this is also due to the staggering distance between high light and shadows.Still, regarding the framing, you could argue that it was to keep the left trees all inside the boundary, but again, with this sky and shadow it doesn't work, at least with this technical solution. I will go further on into what the solution could be.", "Here is where it all goes worse. I'm sorry to have to say this..., but with the framing you've chosen the lighting is just wrong. I'm not giving you a 2 because we can perfectly see the stones and the water, and we can even see underwater which is a nice thing here, to bad you didn't go for it. You're shooting to the shadows when there is more than good light above. Maybe better upstream? Downstream? I just don't know this river. But it certainly is not the time of day in these conditions to make it work without a lot of work afterwords.The colours are somewhat nice, they always are when the Sun starts to dim and subjects profit from the blue light shadows cast everywhere they fall.

And in this case the stones help in creating a nice dynamic for water to draw it's own way into the nice curves we can almost follow. You have a good balance between the river and it's surroundings, although there might be a question if the subject is the river, the trees or both. I don't dislike that, but we do have a problem here... and I should say that if the subject is the river it's being crunched by the over exposed sky.

Not being sure of this I can estimate that you have focused the middle of the image, maybe the cluster of rocks upstream.Sometimes it's hard to argue what should be in focus, but in this case I would say it should be the central piece of rocks, the wet brownish ones, and the depth of field should keep the first and the last  rocks all in... but maybe F8 is a bit short for that...", "Your camera is right for most everything, it's your choice of lens that is less flattering for the subject, a wider angle would go better. The use of your camera is good and bad. As said before exposure is very wrong for the sky (and the sky is taking quite a lot of space in the framing) and the quality of the shadows isn't the best, which suggests there maybe you've done some digital editing to try and correct a not so good overall exposure. Did you shoot this in jpeg? If you did you shouldn't... particularly in this kind of situation where you too much natural contrast between zones.In the other side you show some knowledge for the use of speed. But then again, to get a more dramatic effect, and you would only gain in closing a stop or two, it could be longer. Maybe 1/15s or even less. Too less and you'd loose almost all water texture, but that could work nicely. But be careful with closing too much stops, you don't want to risk diffraction. An F22 would be too much for your camera sensor to process, and there would necessarily be some loss of sharpness due to diffraction.

There also is quite a bit of color mottling at the left most part of the structure, extending a few inches to the left on the headlands area that may have been a result of some cloning work.  I suspect much of these were introduced post processing.  The haloing (white halo around the column of the lighthouse mainly) is possibly from over sharpening, overuse of exposure controls or a strong application of the Tone Mapping/HDR function in Photoshop filters.  There is also a very sharp delineation in the pink tones in the clouds rather than a gradual blending and gradation.  This could be a result of over filtering in general, resulting in loss of segments of the color gamut and thus 'banding' or 'posterization' of the colors. Lastly there is quite a bit of purple fringing, the band of magenta at the margins of the roofline and sky, either brought about by lens distortion, chromatic abberation, or simply a shooting situation where there are extremely high contrast edges.

While the lens used does a good job, it might have been somewhat a limiting factor in this shot. If you have, or have access to a prime lens, or better yet a Macro lens, they would serve you well if you intend to shoot many photos like this one. Macro photography will open a whole new world to you, but those lenses are a bit on the pricy side. Prime lenses generally offer better optics, giving you a faster lens to shoot at lower light levels with a minimum of distortion or focus problems.    I am not sure why you chose to over ride the white balance in the shot. Though I have not calibrated this monitor in some time, your color looks a bit washed out to me, but there could be many reasons for that. I think some of it might be lens distortion. I usually let my camera handle the white balance decisions, and make corrections to white balance in post processing. However, there is nothing wrong with doing so in the field, as long as you can correct it later should you make an error. You may change it no problem if you shoot raw as opposed to Jpeg.    Lighting in your shot was OK, for the most part, but I found it a bit too harsh, and contrasty for my taste. The shadows made the bare earth look cold and forbidding, and the light areas of the plant were blown out on the edges. Shooting plants under full sun or shade are both a blessing and a curse. Our goal is to try to capture them at their best.    Suggestion for this image; Use of light modifiers, such as a shoot through umbrella, or light mesh fabric material to cut down, some of the harsh sunlight, and to help to diffuse some of that light, spreading the light to those darker shadows on the ground. Reflectors can also effect the shot and some times you might resort to using both. (It helps to have an assistant).     I would fully expect that you will find it necessary to shoot at a higher ISO, (200-400) when you soften and diffuse the light.

It was frankly a surprise to me to see that this was a straight capture and not a composite.  Great job on doing so with such great results.  I don't have much to critique on this image other than some additional things you may wish to consider relative to post processing. ", "I think that there are three components to this image that make composition sort of elementary.  Those are the sky, the moon and the jet plane with its contrails.  You had no choice over where the plane crossed the moon so I won't tell you that the placement was not optimal relative to composition.  There is, for me, an excess of black space around the moon but nonetheless the moon is placed nicely in the lower right quadrant of the image which I think works well. The image has taken on an iconic and minimalistic appearance since there is no sky detail to provide a sense of depth.  As a capture it is great however and you could not, in this sort of shooting situation, be faulted for not having foreground, leading lines or other elements in the image to provide hints as to scale and depth.

There is no color to be represented really, and the lighting is straight forward, a plane in silhouette against a fully illuminated moon with a sky gone black as it normally would using a spot meter on the light source.

I really enjoyed writing this critique as it sways a bit more to the side of philosophy and interpretation. I don't know if you were looking for this approach but I'm guessing that with a shot like this you were...", "You have a great composition, that I've described above, and perspective works perfectly well here. There is no way for me to suggest anything better that this as the nature of this shot does not allow for any more understanding.", "In this shot the foam is white and a bit grey and I think it could benefit from having a slight tint of colour. I like the way it's done but I guess it would be more appealing if it had a bit of colour, just a very little bit. The light is just fine, and I love the various reflections of it in the flat water surfaces, such as in the rough areas Perhaps it has some tiny bits of  sparkle that are going a bit further from the whitest possible white in photography. Because a white with no texture is just an empty space, or a statement, and for it to exist and be accepted for what it is there needs to be a reason or an emotional justification. When going beyond frontiers we always need to find it's legitimacy, or else we're just going off for no reason.But this is just for the foam... the rest is beautiful!", "Hi Robert!This is a curious photograph... And water is in fact a very interesting subject, but it was already so explored, so much used and done about that is hard to come up with something that is not redundant. But this fraction of time and space you got here is full of mystery and I love that. Not boring at all! But in the same way it appears to be a little obvious.Abstract photography is the most hard and tough to master, and this is not due technical difficulties but rather because it goes beyond the real of photography per se and enters the world of paint. It's light, yes, drawing with light, but it falls more in the realm of expression with paint and pigment. That expression that is not portraying anything else than an emotion or something of the sort, with non figurative elements. This has to do with what you can convey emotionally and not so much about a message, or a conceptual idea. In that way I don't thing this is so much abstract photography as it is macro photography with movement and a perennial expression of time in a water flow.We can readily see that this is water frozen but a fast shutter speed, not to fast but fast enough, depending on the focal distance, the distance to the subject and the speed of the flow, it could be between 1/125 to 1/500, so we have a bit of motion blur in the \"bottom of the wave\" where water speeds up a bit, and we have it totally frozen, or almost totally frozen on the \"riff of the wave\".Nature gives us this in every corner, we just have to see it, but seeing it is not an easy task, as this is the most difficult thing for us. To see without seeing. I know I'm going a bit to philosophical but the subject requires it. We could just see colours and shapes but we see a little more, or, to say it correctly, we can interpret more. The patterns that water makes turns what could just be taken as abstract to be figurative. It's the big difference between having a phenomenological approach to reality and having the psychological interpretation that always comes along.Anyway, in the bottom left side you have a great mix of clean and transparent water, a beautiful reflex on water with smaller frequency waves, a nice shadow of the boulder and reflex again, darker, which draws a patter that could very well be interpreted as malachite if there wasn't more photograph to \"see\" (interpret) that it's not. On the top left there's a very well textured high key foam a bit out of focus, which is so nice in macro photography. This foam goes all the way to the top right corner, where we can see a rising wall of thin water full of drops reaching out from the convulsion on the bottom right, where we can very well the rocky substance of the boulder.I know it's a boulder because of your description, it could be something else, and this is where the shot gets to be a little more abstract photography that macro photography. But I'm not sure that your first sentence \"(...) I love abstracts in nature (...)\" is enough for any one to make the assumption that you were aiming to do an abstract photograph. This is something I'm just assuming, since there was no reason to start saying that if you weren't aiming for it.In sum, for me, for the reasons I've exposed, this is not really an abstract in nature, but it's close. And I do like the many things I can imagine here, as if this was not a small thing but a big one, a gelatinous mountain, or many, many more things (no time to say them all), or just an Yin-Yang shape of white and green. Be it what it may be for different people, there is something of abstract and something of macro photography in it and you've made me write more then even in the subject section of these critiques.Regardless of what I can analyze aesthetically by recognition of forms/shapes and materials/elements, in my opinion, this is a very interesting but a little confusing photograph. Perhaps a little perplexing. And that can only be good for someone like me, but for other it might just be strange. And this is exactly because it is in a kind of a limbo between abstract and figurative expression. In one side you can recognize what is is and in the other it starts to change it's identity and turning into you own mind experience.Well done!", "To be more of an abstract photograph it had to have less DoF... so that we could not understand the foam, but in the other hand we have the very well illustrated drops of water rising that are in perfect focus...", "Perfect!", "If what I wrote about in the subject section corresponds to what you were trying to do, even if it is not exactly the same thing, you have used your camera very well.
