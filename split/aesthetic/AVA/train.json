There is a beautiful relationship between tone and horizontal distance in this image.  In some places it's bold (the background buildings visible through the mid-layers of the bridge, versus the bridge), and in some places subtle (the watercraft through to and beyond the second bridge).  There's even a gentle tonal separation-by-distance of the major parts of the foreground bridge structure.

The overall concept behind the composition is good; however, The horizon is too busy.

The tree just to the right of the building at the center of image, I would have cloned out as I felt it created a distracting edge with the cloud. I think thats a stop sign just to the left of the building at center. Reminds me of a four way stop on a lone country road and a point of interest and I may have cloned out the trees next to it to make it stand out much the same as the pole next to the building just left of center. Now, having said that, I took the image into photoshop to see if any of this worked. I think removing the tree right of building at center helped and also cloning out the tree behind the building at center helped; however, cropping the right side of the image did not. I also tried increasing the curves and saturation which helped the right side of the image somewhat and did help add some impact to the clouds. One thing about the clouds I did find distracting was the blues and although the blue works well with the yellows in the horizon, I felt they pulled the eye away from the horizon. The last thing I would try is to change is the border. The white in the border kept pulling my eye away from the image and didn't work for me; however, borders like photography are very subjective. The wrong border can hurt an image in the voting. I did try the image with 2 to 5 pix black border and felt it worked better. In summary, adding some curves and saturation to the clouds with selective editing, playing with the horizon to remove distracting elements, and adjusting the border would have helped move the image up in the voting. Even though the horizon may need some minor adjustment, I also think it was the strength of the image. A very nice silouhette! IMO, just needs a little work.

Not only that, he holds in his hand ONE wine glass - the mood of the shot seems to suggest that there should be two. A companion to that glass is missing. Since the main subject is in shadow instead of bathed in light it seems to suggest a time of darkness - a period in which a person has moved into a time that is not so happy. Lastly, the ground plane in the foreground of the shot is all broken and in a state of disrepair - this also suggests to me that the time of this person's life is broken; is in disrepair.

The reflection of the butterfly wing is too solid (?) and not glassy (look at the reflection of the throat of the frog to see what I mean).

Placing the camera low to the ground and shooting angled up so that the figures appear more on the backdrop of the blue sky would have made them as visible as those ghostly figures you see in the background faintly silhouetted on the ocean.

But the environment could have been brought in to add more visual interest. The inclusion of the ground plane that composes 70% of the composition 'visually' grounds the bird. What I mean by that is that had the photo been taken at a lower angle such that the sky makes up more of the backdrop it would compliment the bird more by making a visual connection to it's natural element. Not only that but the colors of the bird would contrast and pop more visually off of a background with some same color hues that compete with the subject's coloration. Now your sky here is a flat white and grey so you might have wanted to avoid that because it was not visually interesting. However, could you have photographed it later in the day or even another day where there might be more interesting sky patterns? If the opportunity was available then always try to take advantage of the best possible settings. Lastly, the eye of the beautiful bird could use a bit of catchlights to add some depth and gleam to the eye. Could you have changed your angle such that the sunlight reflected in the bird's eyes or possibly have used fill flash to hopefully add a gleam to the eye (of course, you would only do this if the falcon/hawk would not react violently to the use of flash or be startled).", "Awesome shot.."], "label": 1, "image": ["763181.jpg"]}, {"text": ["Very nice image.

I had to look a few times before I realised what I saw.

The fact that the chosen subject is emblematic of purity and innocence causes the contrast set up in the post-processing effect to be amplified to the point where the mind has difficulty merging the ideas of \"child\" with this unusual and stark technique.
