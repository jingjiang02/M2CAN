Your square and checkerboard is 'floating' in space.  There is nothing wrong with that.. just my personal preference.  I would have possibly even clipped onto the square with my crop.  Secondly, I would have possibly pursued a lower camera angle.  The reason for this is that I believe you could have made the reflection of the checkerboard play very nicely on the metal square.
