The saturation is a bit much, though", "About how fast was this ferry moving? I'm looking to recreate this in Wisconsin this summer, tips?", "I love the concept, but there are a few things that aren't quite working for me in the composition.  \n\nFor one thing, it's not quite symmetrical. The camera is slightly to the right of the center of the ferry. This means the bow is off center relative to the viewer and direction of travel, which to me makes it look like the boat is turning left, or like it was built crooked. \n\nDoes that make sense? I know it's a subtle thing, but once I saw it I couldn't stop seeing it. I think if you were in line with the center of the ship then the viewer's perspective, the ship, and the perceived motion would all line up nicely, but right now it's just a little off. \n\nThe other thing is that it's hard to see the motion. It's there in the land formations, but that's such a narrow part of your composition. You can't really see any motion in the water or the sky, and that's the majority of the image. The blur causes leading lines, but they aren't quite strong enough. Most of this image looks like it's holding still. I'm not sure what you can do about that, but overall I did not immediately get a feeling of motion from his image. If you hadn't told me what you were going for, it would not have been immediately obvious. \n\nLike I said, I love the concept, but it's one of those shots were you need everything to line up just right to give the impression you want.

This foprmat ensures that all the information you capture with your sensor is kept within the photograph. Shooting in .JPG results in color loss. \n2: I highly recommend getting an editing program like Adobe Lightroom. This in combination with shooting in RAW gives you enormous freedom when it comes to creating the image you want. \n3: Aperture, Shutterspeed and ISO are the three main settings you should learn if you want to use your camera properly. The aperture allows the amount of light coming in and is expressed in F-stops. A low F-number (F2.8 for example) is equivalent to a lot of light, whereas a high F-number (F22) only allows a small portion of light to go through. Shutter speed is a bit self-explanatory but you can vary your shutter from a thousandth of second to how long you'd like. ISO is the sensitivity of the sensor and should be kept in mind when photographing in light or dark areas. \n\nYoutube has a ton of fantastic tutorials and i als recommend going to exhibitions every now and then. \n\nGood luck!"], "label": 1, "image": ["2018-photocritique-submission_7z4lq3-image.jpeg"]}, {"text": ["love those light leaks", "That's a lot of chromatic aberration!!

You're trying to make an abstract composition out of a 3-dimensional thing, and that's harder than it looks. I think your instincts were right that this building is a good subject, but I don't think you quite got there (yet) with this image.\n\nFor me, what makes \"abstract architecture\" shots work is when the composition is extremely well thought-out. The placement of every line is deliberate. The easiest way is to take advantage of the building's natural geometry and emphasize that. Or crop tightly to emphasize a single curve or set of lines, or row of windows, or whatever.\n\nHere, you're looking up. I'd argue that that's the least interesting perspective for a building. It's the default, it's the way we always see buildings. Unless you're doing something new or different or interesting with it ... it's tough to make that work. It's ordinary and common. The goal of abstract photography (and arguably of photography generally) is to make the viewer see something in a **new** way.\n\nTake a look at this portfolio (not mine):\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/architecture_anatomy/\n\nSee how the buildings are reduced to relatively simple shapes. The photographer tries to emphasize the overall feel of the building with a tiny part of it. The part reflects the whole.\n\nFWIW, I photograph a **lot** of buildings, and I rarely am able to \"see\" a building this way. It's not easy. \n\nWhat I'd suggest is: an exercise. If you are able return to this building, do so. Bring a few different lenses. Force yourself to take at least 100 photos of the building. Don't repeat the same composition twice. Then save the top two or three best images, and delete the rest. Process the best one and post somewhere for critique.\n\nBonus points if you can do this exercise during \"golden hour\" when the sun is low in the sky.\n\nHope this helps.", "I like it.

While I somewhat agree, I also live in WA and well, if you're waiting around for dramatic lighting most of the year you're going to be spending a lot of time standing around. My personal advice for this photo is to reconsider from the ground up what you're trying to communicate and get away from the diagonal lines and the oblique perspective. The interest I see in this scene is the red windows and door, contrasted against the green roof and surrounds.\n\nYou can work with the light in this scene by making it more about the colors (which overcast is great for) as well as recomposing to be a touch more linear, which holds its own interest. \n\nEveryone who takes a photo usually stands at a \"good\" spot (often a driveway or some other good standing-spot) and gets a slightly angled perspective, or puts no thought into the exact angle at all and just snaps a photo. A spot that's good for standing or for backing up and taking the photo may not be the best angle to produce the best photo -- it would just produce the best standing spot. Warning, you may need to get your feet wet, heh.\n\nThis cabin is loaded with strong, straight lines. Siding, roof lines, windows. A more impactful photo would be produced, in this instance, by enhancing them instead of converting them to diagonals. I suggest standing directly in front and being careful to place your lens so it is shooting perpendicular to the facade so that everything is straight and horizontal/vertical after lens correction. A perfectly, or near-perfectly, horizontal line holds a lot of visual weight, whereas a mass of lines at an angle communicate a more uncertain energy, or tend to redirect attention instead of holding it.\n\nI'd compose so that the door is my primary subject. I'd place the windows towards the edge of the frame. I'd clip the roof in such a way that the lines of it disappear past the edge of the frame, clipping the apex of the roof and thus reinforcing the door. It may also be possible to include the apex of the roof but it will depend on what the terrain is like and what height you can achieve, but I'm guessing without walking off 500 yards and using a telephoto you're not going to be able to nail it.\n\nA bright red door like that on a rustic cabin in a forest is going to look great after you run it through Lightroom or whatever processing software you use. But it's important to not let it get muddied in a greater scene. Photos are all about simplification. \n\nNo matter what course you might choose for this photo in hindsight, I'd suggest that your first course of action in the future is to identify the exact point you think will be the center of attention in your photo and work outwards from there to build a composition, working with what is available. I may well be wrong, this is a blind guess, but I'm betting you shoot a lot of photos and then cull to find the worthy ones. I learned this way myself and still sometimes shoot that way for casual or documentary photos. for fine art, It's better to learn to see the photo in your head based on points of interest and then shoot it, instead of looking for \"the photo\" in your card dump of random shots you took. No offense intended if that sounded harsh at all.\n\nI don't think this photo alone is without worth, though. Just some points to think about.", "I love the colors and exposure of the cabin, and surrounding vegetation.

The lighting doesn\u2019t work for me either. Try to use the magic hours for more dramatic lighting. The first hour after sunrise and the last hour before sundown. The lighting then is spectacular and may give you a new dimension on the cabin. I\u2019m not sure if the trees will allow a lot of the light in but can only try. I like the colors of the cabin and the surrounding area. Good luck. Hope you repost after trying different shots", "I\u2019ll tell ya what, it is very damp up here and you captured the rain and moss and woodsy feel nicely without under exposing too much", "This is a pretty cool photo! Great for this sub because it's neither too bland nor too perfect for any feedback :-) .\n\nTwo things come to mind: composition and drama. Both have already been discussed by other commenters but here's my two cents, too.\n\n**Composition:** I would give the house a bit more breathing room, particularly at the bottom. I would love to see the path leading to the house (if it exists). It could serve as a leading line (great concept btw!) and also give the photo more depth.\n\n**Drama:** Waiting for better light is obviously not going to work. So we need to make it pop with editing. I can see two ways how to help: First, the photo is quite dark overall, and second, the house doesn't stand against the forests that much. So here's some suggestions:\n\n* Boost brightness - I'd do that regardless, and quite strongly, *almost* to the point that the roof gets blown out. \n* The house walls are quite dark still, and most notably the door. I'd dodge it a bit (since we can't increase brightness more).\n* Make the trees darker. If you're lazy, a vignette would do, but you can also play with dodge/burn for a better effect (it's a ton of work though). \n\nHere's a quick attempt to show what I mean: [https://imgur.com/a/cR4yr94](https://imgur.com/a/cR4yr94) .

If your photos look good (yours do), then they look good. It doesn't matter what you did or how you got there.

Using something a lot because you like how it looks is not the same as using it as a crutch. \n\nOnly you know if you are using it as a crutch.

If you look at you subject and think \"the background is not what I wan't anyone to focus on - I will draw attention to the subject using a low f-stop\" then you are using it creatively. Crutch implies that you need it to help you take a good photo. \n\nTake the beach chairs as an example: You have drawn attention to the guy instead of the chairs.\n\n- If you wanted to take a pic of your friend down the beach but knew he was gonna be small in the frame so you decided to put chairs in the foreground and use a low f-stop to make sure viewers were aware that he is still your subject, while giving context to the scene - Hooray! you used a small DOF in a cool creative way and you made a nice shot.\n\n- If you were sat on the beach behind those chairs and din't have an idea of what your subject was and just thought it usually looks pretty cool if you use a shallow DOF - you are probably using it as a crutch.\n\nYou still end up with a cool photo either way. The downside is that if you always fall back on something that gives you know with give you a good result easily, you won't get better at doing anything else.

One of the key point of good composition is Most photos need a good clear focal point and this one doesn\u2019t have a focal point.\n\nLet me start by defining some terminology.\n\n**Your subject** should be thought of as what you wanted to show, what you were looking at or what specifically you want people to notice..\n\n**Point of interest** is what your eyes are drawn to and holds you attention. Lots of people call that you subject so it can get confusing. A point of interest CAN be the subject but doesn\u2019t have to be the intended subject.\n\nA Focal Point is important because your eye needs a place to rest and something to hold your attention. Without it, people will glance at you photo and move on. Pay attention to how your eyes move around the photo. For example, if you have a good leading line does it lead to something interesting to look at?\n\nWhen you take a photo ask yourself what do I want people to see? What am I trying to show them?\n\nWhen I glance at this my eyes wander around the photo looking for something to look at. Since I wasn't there, I don't have any emotions toward the photo so it doesn't have any meaning to me.\n\nYour Point of Interest needs to be prominent in the photo. When you take the photo ask yourself, what do I want the people to see? Then focus on that and make it stand out in the frame. Look around the frame at everything else you are about to capture and not just what ever caught you attention. Backgrounds Matter!

Another version could be self reflection, and in this case, I would have her look herself in the eyes in her own reflection. Many stories you could tell! But great shot overall, love the colors!! Portrait photography is about the person and the story (unless it\u2019s fashion photography - then it\u2019s about selling clothes, haha).

Generally, you should actually avoid centering prominent objects because it creates tension on either side (and/or above and below). In this case, the visual mass of the two large buildings to the viewer's left is balanced by the sum of the visual weight of the cluster of smaller structures to the right. In addition, by placing the horizon below the center of the frame, you a) eliminated uninteresting foreground clutter, and b) emphasized the dramatic expanse of sky, which creates a lovely environmental contrast. You also nailed the exposure, which is tricky given the depth of shadows and widely-varying intensity of light sources.\n\nThe only thing that *could* be lacking, compositionally, is a single foreground object (e.g. ground-mounted satellite dish, derelict car, person walking toward the buildings, etc.) to serve as a singular point of interest. Otherwise, the viewer has to select for him/herself what the photo's subject is (this, of course, is largely based upon my personal taste, and is not to be construed as a fault of the image).\n\nOverall, this is a well-executed photo.

The smoothed ripples in the water are more interesting than the sky in my eyes. Also, the small gap of water visible between the orange bank and the left edge of the frame is distracting to my eye.

I think it would look more natural and perhaps more impactful to have the background skyline be more saturated but cooler. To my eye as someone who cherishes this particular view, the skyline buildings are too desaturated, it pulls me out of the scene because it's too different from my own memory of the view. If you left the saturation in, but brought the temperature of the background more towards the blue, I think you would retain the effect you were but without the flatness the background has in this edit.\n\nFinally, I think the denoise treatment is too aggressive. Did you use Topaz Denoise here? I think you could stand the back the settings off a fair amount, as the denoise treatment in this photo has crushed any sense of fine detail in the structure of the brick in the well lit areas, and the aggressive chroma noise correction has muddied the fine nuances of the orange tones in the midground. Given that this was taken at base ISO I think you could allow some additional noise to remain in the image to trade back some of that fine detail.

Whether it's making sure the shot is taken at the peak of an ollie, or with the board midway rotated over a ledge flipping in, or locked in about 1/4 of the way down a rail, there's a sweet spot that just takes a lot of practice to get down.\n\n>Next is the composition. With skating, your audience isn't necessarily other photographers, it's other skaters, and we want to see what the trick is, what the spot is, how the skater is stylizing the trick. Basically we want you to make the skater look really good while making the trick look rad. This means composing the spot so that we can imagine the conclusion of the trick. Landing area is important, the lead room to anticipate the direction and space that the skater is going to take up. (in your image the skater is right in the center and the frame is vertical, using a large part of the frame to capture the less interesting runway, as well as giving the image vertical movement instead of horizontal) Then consider the best angles that would highlight this movement, as well as capture the aesthetics of the trick/skater. Is the skater going to be turning in the air? Will this mean their back will be turned to you? (bad) Will an angle compress the space from the ground in the photo, making the trick or the rail or ledge look short and therefore less impressive? Which direction is the skaters toe going to point, what's their posture like doing the tricks, how does the board spin or level out? These are all things to consider.\n\n>I'd suggest taking a look at some of the past examples of somewhat recent skate photos here (sorry about the site, it's a little wonky having to click each photo to get it out of the squished square aspect ratio) and just kind of get a vibe for what works.

The image as it is is how you'd see with your eyes.  A standard focal length and eye level view with the point of view towards the horizon.  Nothing is emphasized.\n\nIf you used a wider focal length, you could give more sense of distance in the image.  This would probably work better if your point of view was closer to the ground.  This would place a lot of emphasis on the ground and the path.  The trees would compose the background.  If you pointed upward with a wide angle lens you could emphasize the trees and background.  You could still be close to the ground or not if you want.  The difficulty with wide angle is that it gets so much in, there's always the risk of having elements in the shot that don't support your overall composition.  For instance there might be something that takes away from the pattern of the trees just out the frame that you might not want.  Simplicity is more powerful after all.\n\nIf you went with a telephoto lens you'd have to be much further away.  This will compress the distance between the path and the trees making it appear flater.  The trees in the background will have more promenance, but you'll end up with less tree overall.  Especially the top of the trees which will most likely be lost.  With telephoto, where you point has less impact on the perspective.\n\nI'd recommend experimenting with where you point you camera and where you stand.  Often when I'm contemplating a shot, I walk forward and back playing with my point of view.  You don't really know until you try it.\n\nOverall, I like the composition.  It's clean and uncluttered which is important for a coherant composition.  The tone of the image is pleasant too.  The tone is what people feel emotionally when they see the image and it can be argued that this is the most important aspect especially when being viewed by a non photographer.\n\nThe lighting is nice with an appealing low angle in the sky.  I bet if you waited a bit longer, the lighting would have warmed up as it gets near to sunset and would have made the overall image pleasantly warm.  Making the image warmer will affect the tone and will make it even warmer.  Like you want to wrap yourself in the scene and feel good.

I love the reflections, angle of the ground on the left side drawing me into the entire depth of the photo, and the detail up close that makes it easy to understand what I\u2019m looking at. The only thing I might change is the position from which the photo is taken, shifting slightly away from the boulder/cliff on the right. It\u2019s a bit imposing and makes me feel like it\u2019s too big and blocking me from seeing more of the photo. If you can get close to the same angles while moving away from that right side, wow. Again, love this! Those colors!", "Really nice as a desktop background. Great colours and contrast.\n\nIf I were to critique outside of that, would say there's a little lack of a subject.

Perhaps a person in a boat would be a nice addition so I know where my eyes are meant to go. \n\nOther than that, great capture!", "I like the colors and overall feeling.\n\nBut when looking at it longer/closer:\n- cliffs on left look a bit unnatural. Too much HdR and the sunlite comes slightly from the left so cannot illuminate left side so much\n- and there seems too much smoothness. Water is fine, but need sharpness on other parts to balance it out", "Nice image overall!\n\nContrary to others, I think the composition is pretty much spot on. You have three active triangles in your image: the left cliff face and its shadow; the right cliff face (this one's a \"soft\" triangle, but a triangle nonetheless); and most importantly the three boulders. All are guiding the viewer's eye into the setting sun on the horizon.\n\nI also compliment you on the color toning, which is really eye-catching.\n\nI'd suggest just three things:\n\n1) Try toning down the dodging on the left cliff face. As it is now, that cliff face looks too bright in relation to where the sun is coming from. This makes the viewer (at least me) think that a sky replacement was done. If that's the case, then you need to be careful about lighting consistency when doing sky replacements, but I'm thinking you didn't do a sky replacement, but rather over-dodged the cliff a bit.\n\n2) Consider darkening the right cliff more. Same as with 1), the right cliff face is noticeably too bright for where the light in the image is coming from. I think too that having that cliff darker would make the luminosity in the rest of the image stand out better.\n\n3) You have color clipping there where the sun is, which means there are unfortunate \"blobs\" of yellow in the sky. There are two ways of dealing with that: either back off a bit, so that the color clipping is corrected; or let that light blow out for real, to give a real flood-of-light effect to the image. This third point is the only one that I see as being fundamentally important. \"*You need to pull back your highlights to keep all your dynamic range,*\" the internet fashionably screams. Fine. but make sure that there's no color clipping either in that case. I however say hogwash. Don't be afraid of letting extremely bright light, like, say, the sun within the framing of an image, go completely white centrally, with the colors gradually reappearing with distance. It's a more natural, what-one's-eyes-would-really-see approach, but it also allows the viewer to really *feel* the light.\n\nAgain, very nicely done overall, and happy shooting to you.\n\nPS: is that a guy fishing at the end of the left cliff?", "I'll weigh in.\n\n* Try a bit of reductionism here. No need for the rocks in the foreground, I think the more interesting composition is the rock in between the two walls. I would've moved forward to do that or see what's more to the right.\n\n* Not sure if the rays in the background are real (i'm inclined to say no since they're spreading out, but I don't know the area or the actual time this was taken), but they're a nice touch.\n\n* I think the orton effect is overused here, if that's the haze you put on. And I don't think the image calls for it. It's a sunny-ish day, on the beach, not a foggy/moody forest. \n\n* You\u2019ve set your camera on a good timer to get the water looking like this\n\n* I think you can exposure blend a tiny bit better here. The right wall somehow looks a bit unnatural.\n\n* I think you could underexpose the sky a bit more.

I love landscapes and buildings. Here's some suggestions, but please take this all with a grain of a salt: \n\n* Generally it's a good idea to use F8 or F11 to get optimal sharpness in your photos. Right now your photo is suffering from diffraction at F22 hence why it looks soft. \n\n* With long exposures a smaller aperture will create \"star bursts\" as you see in the light sources of your photo. Getting a wider aperture will lessen that star effect and make the other competing elements less distracting. \n\n* The building on the left doesn't add value here and you could eliminate it. Also, the foreground is not all that interesting. What might look better is if you had a different vantage point. I understand this is from your balcony but if you want a better vantage point you have to try a different spot in the city you're in. I'd highly recommend googling hot spots where you can get a good perspective of the building and still have wiggle room to frame elements to your taste. Planning ahead of time and thinking carefully how you want to frame and compose your shot will make all the difference. This is the distinction between someone who \"points and shoots\" versus an artist. \n\n* Lighting could be greatly improved. Night shots like this are hard because the dark sky creates a flat background. Which means the photo feels very monotone having a black sky with a dark building. Which is why I'd try getting closer or to a different location so you can better photograph this building and have car streaks for your long exposure to make it all the more dramatic. Try experimenting with the golden hour or blue hour (sunset or sunrise) and find what lighting works for you or doesn't work for you. You can shoot at night but try to find a way to create natural contrast and make your subject pop out more in the dark. Avoid using Lightroom to compensate for this or \"save\" your photo. That should be the last step in your vision for this building. \n", "Well, it's somewhat prosaic: \"Here is a skyscraper at night\".

I want to add a couple of things about the compositing.\n\nSo, if three exposures worked so well...why not go nuts and use twenty or thirty?  That's typically what I'll do with small product photography.  I use one (often a little underexposed) shot as base, and then wander around and catch a bunch of images where I am just hitting the subject with a speedlight from different angles I think will be useful (I use modifiers too to create certain effects, so this isn't just spray and pray).  In particular...\n\nI would like to see the seat, exhaust pipe, and generally the middle area of the bike lit less brightly.  Instead, dimmer light with some dramatic gleaming highlights.  Strobe the areas and then paint in the highlights in Photoshop (PS).\n\nAlso, the Honda logo right in the middle of the bike... Strobe that, then make a layer in PS that is just the letters in Honda in this strobed image.  You can then blend that layer with the darker layer and adjust the opacity to get just the right amount of light catching the logo.  You can even run a gradient across it, whatever seems to work.  Right now it is catching a little light, but not much, and that is too evenly matched by the lights on the surface around the logo.\n\nDon't be afraid to use compositing to alter your image.

I go minimum f/2.8 or f/3, and go up from there depending on the length of the dog's snout and the background.  F/1.8 is fun for some things, but it's a large enough aperture to put something on the dog's face out of focus but small enough that it doesn't look like it was on purpose.\n\nSecond biggest piece of advice - black dogs need a lot of soft light across the whole face.

", "Congrats on the new camera, especially after saving for so long. Now comes the fun part, learning to use it :)\n\nThere appears to be an old nail underneath the water there. If that\u2019s intended to be your subject, then I think you need to get much closer to it, and frame the shot so that it really stands out. If you subject is intended to be the gap itself, then the nail is distracting. \n\nIn either case, I agree with the other commenters that it\u2019s not a great subject in and of itself. It\u2019s not bad, but fairly mundane. However, the fact that you have a clear subject at all puts you ahead of a lot of new photographers, so I don\u2019t want you to feel discouraged. Commonplace subjects certainly *can* work, but in order to make them interesting enough to carry the photo they generally need to make some sort of statement, or present the subject in a way that people don\u2019t usually see. Make sense? This is a good first step though.\n\nAssuming that the gap is the subject, then you have a very harsh shadow falling on it that I don\u2019t think is ideal. If you squint your eyes, the highlights and shadows appear to form two distinct shapes, rather than a rectangular gap. \n\nAs such, this shot might have looked better with different light. Morning and afternoon light are often very pretty, but sometimes they just don\u2019t fall where you want them to. There are multiple ways that you might have gotten more even lighting, and without being there it\u2019s hard for me to say which would work best in this particular situation. So these are just options to consider for next time.\n\nOne would be to come back at noon, when the sun would be overhead. For most photography, noon light is usually not what you want, but for this it might have illuminated the gap in the stones more evenly. A day with some nice even cloud cover can also give you a more diffuse light, and any shadows will be less harsh. The trade off is that the light will not be as warm. \n\nThis particular shot might have worked very well right after a rain. The clouds would give you a very even light, and the wet surface tends to really bring out the colors in the bricks and the greens. Just in general, after (or even during) rain is often an excellent time for photography, especially once you get yourself a polarizer (which reduces glare, and really makes those colors pop). \n\nAnother potential option would be to find a different angle, so that the shadow didn\u2019t appear in the shot. In this case that would probably mean getting lower to the ground, and shooting from the side a bit. Again, I don\u2019t know what you were working with, but that would probably change your composition considerably. Something to consider though.\n\nAnother way to even things out would be to use some large object (or person) to cast a shadow over everything in your shot. A shadow is going to be more even lighting than direct sunlight.\n\nThe composition is also a bit haphazard. It\u2019s nice and simple, which is excellent, with no major distractions other than the nail. That\u2019s a good start. For a simple shot like this I would suggest trying a classic rule of thirds composition, or a symmetrical one. This shot isn\u2019t quite either.\n\nThis is a good start.

Photos like this work better if the leading lines (your road there) lead towards the subject but in a pleasantly aesthetic way, usually either winding from the foreground or exactly straight and dissecting the image. It's uncomfortable to view because the road is instead skewed off from centre and appears careless. Luckily, this can be easily fixed without reshooting using photo editing software.\n\nThe second issue is that your subject is ill defined and just generally uninteresting. You can't make out enough of the truck for it to hold any attention and the eye veers off towards the (also boring) tree on the right. A bit of patience and waiting to find something unique to photograph will improve your photography no end.\n\nThirdly, the mountains are hazy and detract from the overall quality of the photo. A CPL filter would have cut straight through this - they are relatively inexpensive and are a must for landscape photography. If you did have a CPL on the camera, you didn't use it well.\n\nFourth and final issue, this looks like it was taken at midday and so the lighting is very harsh.

The best way to get into it is by looking at street photographer's books.

There is no interaction between your subjects or between you and your subjects. people are just working in the middle of the frame and a lot of the frame is unused. There's no story, drama, or mystery going on. It is a literal representation of a shop on the street with workers. Nothing interesting is happening and the composition sort of lends itself to that lack of anything going on.\n\nIf you want an honest critique that will likely help you grow as a street photographer and you are on Flickr, I suggest throwing it up on [HCSP critique thread](https://www.flickr.com/groups/onthestreet/discuss/72157637994366446/). There's a lot of crap on there, but you might be able to get some good ideas on how to make things better in the future.\n\nOne last thing: something a lot of people are suggesting here, which I would strongly discourage is cropping your photograph.
