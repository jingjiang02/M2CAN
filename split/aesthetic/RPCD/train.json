Personally, I'm a sucker for anything with real film (especially black and white) but the composition here is great too. The elements on the right lead to the vanishing point that is also the literal \"light at the end of the tunnel.\" It's a great visual trick to draw attention to that part, especially since the eye is always attracted to the brighter parts of a photo. The other good part about it is that you have your figure right in that light. The silhouette is great because it gives the idea of a person rather than all the individual features (which I think works very well here) and its a striking contrast from the almost perfectly white light at the end. The contrast setting seems perfect to me especially because of that effect with the light and the person. And the grain seems just about right to me, as it adds an element of grittiness or edginess. The only real advice I could give would be to burn the bright gaps on the right side a bit more. It would be good to see more detail in the ground there and it would stop distracting me from the left corner (which I assume is the subject) and help me focus more on the progression from the lower right corner to that vanishing point. \n\nTL;DR Composed well, nice contrast, good grain.

But you are here for a critique and not pat on the back so here goes...\n\n1. The focus is a bit off on the eyes.  Just barely.  You can tell by seeing that the lashes are in a different focus than the pupils.  For example her left eye, our right, is out of focus but the lashes are in focus.  The other eye is closer to being in focus, but the lashes are not as sharp as the other eye.  You could fix this by going for a smaller aperture, which would make the sweater not as blurred out.  Or you could have her be facing more at the camera.  Or...\n2. There is quite a bit you could have done to edit the eyes, and there are a lot of videos on YouTube showing how to do it.  But the basic steps are:  Darken and expand the pupils.  Sharpen the iris (sometimes drawing in detail that wasn't there to begin with).  Improve the iris color.  Remove any red veins in the whites.  And then add in any (fake) reflections from the lighting.  Because the eyes are such a focal point of this picture, I would spend a good amount of time on just this.  While you are at it, sharpen up the lashes.   \n3. The colors in this photo are what I'd call \"cold\".  This is also could be an artistic choice, so what I say isn't necessarily correct for you.  But I would try to warm things up.  Maybe starting by shifting the white balance to something warmer.  Then playing with things to move the skin tones more pink/tanned.  MAYBE edit the lip color to be a TINY BIT less subdued.  \n4. Again, this one is an artistic choice that you can disagree with.  I would consider editing the hair a little bit to reduce or remove those fly-away hairs to the right of her eye, or on the left of her neck.  You have to be careful with this, however.  Those blurry fly-away hairs do add some depth and personality to the photo so you shouldn't go too far with this.\n\nAnd most importantly, with any edits a little goes a long way.  Edit it up to the point you think it's perfect, and then back off a bit.  ", "Beautiful shot. I like the way you did the soft light. Maybe try a bit more contrast to get a more dramatic effect.

Usually like to see a catchlight in the eyes but given that she's looking off scene I like the light in her eyes, its gentle as you say. The left side of the image really shows the structure and shape of her face while the right side of the image is warm and shows nice skin, which really shows the complexity of the beauty of the face (weird to write but I think it's true)\n\nThe colors are good, there's only two schemes, hair sweater eyes are similar and then skin tones with the red lips are the contrast in color but not extreme. Background color / nothing also appropriate. Skin tone /white balance I like for what you're trying to evoke and it goes well with her expression.", "lighting: Awesome. Very well done.

I would also recommend using the rule of thirds on this shot. The biggest flaw and first thing I noticed is how the model is centered in frame and shot with a very wide lens.

Having your model off center and oversized in your composition gives the illusion of professionalism because it adds mystique to the photo. When you include the entire models body in the shot and subsequent foreground and background, it makes an image seem boring. I see everything in the image and for me, the illusion of story telling is broken. \n\nTo save yourself time in post (in reference to the background) shoot at a lower aperture to get more blur. Small details and edits will slowly become less important the more those items are out of focus. If you\u2019re shooting Sony, I would recommend starting with this lens on amazon (Viltrox 85mm 1.8). It\u2019s a really well built, cheap option to start playing around with a super low aperture and yields decent results. \n\nThese are only personal preference.

The key is the main light, the fill fills in the shadows, the rim is one from behind and overhead that makes the head and shoulders pop from the background and the catch is the light reflected in the eyes (usually the catch and the key are the same light). Next time you shoot, try to find a way to get the key bigger or closer so it makes the eyes sparkle. This will also serve to define the shadows with more clarity. Also, try playing with a rim light. It\u2019ll help define the edges of your subject much more clearly. \n2) The neck is rolling off into complete shadow.

It'd be better without the reflection as well, but I understand that getting rid of it might have been challenging and editing is unlikely to be able to remove it.\n\nThe lighting is a tad harsh, but I think it works - with the exception of your left eye (which is on the right side of the image, just to be clear.)   The shadow there is too dark, so back off the darkening you did in post.  Make sure we can distinguish between the iris and the pupil.  In fact, you might want to back off the darkening entirely, or even lighten them.\n\nAlso, your white balance is off.  Tone down the magenta-tint and increase color temperature if you're working in RGB, or boost the yellow channel if you're in CMYK.  Note that doing this will make your eyes a little yellow, but nothing that you can't fix.\n\nFinally, because of the reflection, the glass behind you is obvious and puts a barrier between the viewer and the background.  This could be improved by darkening the night sky to true black, but I'm afraid that editing won't be able to remove that barrier entirely.\n\nNow, even after saying that much, I think this is a good portrait.

There is a formula with which you can calculate the maximum exposure time before you can see trails forming but I generally use my rule of thumb of <= 30 seconds of exposure time.This also means that when taking exposures across several minutes you will need to separate the sky and align the stars between each of the images (I like to use the blend mode difference for aligning separate images)\n\nBtw you can also use the stars movement across the sky for style, creating images [such as this](https://imgur.com/a/kuRC3R8)\n\nOne last thing, I can highly recommend getting [a remote such as this](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Rollei-remote-release-illuminated-display/dp/B01KVE777S/ref=sr_1_3?crid=GNIXQP3OQCOQ&dchild=1&keywords=kamera+fernbedienung&qid=1635715130&sprefix=kamera+remote%2Caps%2C106&sr=8-3) which allows you to not only take several images without the fear of moving the camera but also allows you to take exposures longer than 30 seconds (if you camera doesn't allow that). A remote like this only costs like 20 Euros and is definitely worth it in my opinion\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo finally critique the image, the plane is definitely something I would try to remove for future images (so by taking several exposures of the stars and stacking them). Also it looks like stars are slightly out of focus or you may have touched the camera a bit so that is something you may want to watch out for next time you shoot.Overall pretty good image though, definitely better than my first try photographing the stars", "Here ya go...\n\nhttps://www.davemorrowphotography.com/p/tutorial-shooting-night-sky.html", "Beautiful shot and lucky with the shooting star. I'd definitely suggest shooting RAW. Not going to hurt anything other than storage space shooting both RAW and JPG. Also, if you're going to shoot stars, may I suggest putting it in manual focus, zoom your display in as far as possible and tweak the focus until as focused as possible. This will prevent your camera from trying to focus on stuff closer, and the auto focus isn't terribly accurate when doing night shots.\n\nKeep up the great work!", "Awesome shot!

That kind of brown only detracts from the scheme, so using a neutral white might be best.\n\nAngle of view:  This is a tough one because the angle of the table looks good, however the mixing bowls angle isn't great.  I really want to see what's going on in that bowl, and considering that this shot 'should' emphasize chocolate, the image lacks the 'product'.

Overall, it feels a bit over exposed.\u200b (foreground)\r  \n\r  \nThe \r  \nf1/22 results in a star effect around the lights. \r  \nBackground:\r  \nLong exposure in the night = background + trails.\n\n* Not sure this was the ideal location. Find a place with distinctive surrounding and a road for bypassing cars.\r  \n\r  \n**See some older write up by me from older posts combined:**\r  \n\r  \nNow, for a long exposure: you make the picture in 2 steps (phases). Most people go directly for the long exposure effect. That's wrong.\r  \n\r  \n\u200bStarting point, find a good (better) location, :-)\r  \n\r  \n1- First step: set the base exposure for the surroundings.\r  \n\r  \nI completely focus on the EXPOSURE of the surroundings (buildings / street/light poles). I'm not focusing on the 'long exposure effects'. But it is not a picture I will use at the end, since light trails might suck. It's just to get the base exposure. At the end you want trails WITH nice surroundings.\r  \n\r  \nBest thing to do: (manually = M) figure out setting to get a correct exposure (exposure triangle):\r  \n\r  \n\\- ISO low as possible\r  \n\r  \n\\- aperture about 8\\~11 (don't go to 22 due to stars)\r  \n\r  \n\\- shutter what you need for the exposure. This exposure combination is 'fixed'.\r  \n\r  \nSo ignore the cars (light trails). First you want the buildings /street to look good.\r  \n\r  \nOnly when I'm happy with (the exposure of) the background, I focus on the light trails. But keeping the total exposure the same (amount of light coming in). At the end they appear together in the same shot. You should see this as a steps in building-up (the final overall) exposure (=EV) of a shot. See second step for this.\r  \n\r  \n2 - Second step: making the trails.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, do this within the set exposure. This becomes trial/error, but don't change the overall EV. You want to keep background perfect. (if you don't get this, look for exposure triangle)\r  \n\r  \nSo every step in exposure (like shutter longer) needs to be compensated by aperture or ISO (so total EV strays the same).\r  \n\r  \nThis largely depends on the speed of the cars. Especially if they driving too slow in inner-city, you might become stuck (too much light means you will get short trails).\r  \n\r  \nDo test shots for trails.\r  \n\r  \nToo short, lower the shutter speed (longer exposure) compensate this with lower ISO (or smaller aperture).\r  \n\r  \nSee what the effect is on the trails.\r  \n\r  \nTo be honest, depending on length of the included road and/or speed of traveling by cars at location (length of the trails), I do sometimes merger multiple shots to make one long trail.\r  \n\r  \nThe same for head lights approaching you. These might be too strong. Sometimes I will blend those in as well in an 'empty picture' (shot without incoming cars).\r  \n\r  \nIf I blend, I blend-in additional light trails. So my example picture below, base shot has only the left light trails in it (no right trails). I just waited few minutes for good right trails. I blended those in using a layer blending mode for highlights.\r  \n\r  \nYou can make a luminosity mask based on saturation/color, this can be use to make the trails pop without impacting other colors. But you need a tool for that.\r  \n\r  \nTake a lot of shots. See what you can use and what not.\r  \n\r  \n\u200b\r  \n\r  \nExample: Merger of 2 shots (not perfect: don't like the stars and length of trails, but was confronted with too much light and slowly driving cars).

Then I took all the redish hues (red, orange and yellow) and turned them more towards the red side, muted the tones so they are not too red! I took the green and made it more yellow, teals toward blue and desaturate and turn down the luminescence so that aren't too powerful, left the blue alone and turned the purple and magenta town just a touch. Then I sharpened and smoothed out the photo a little bit to knock down the grain from the high ISO. Then I cropped in from the sky and situated the image towards the right side to have the two buildings split the center of the photo cropped the sky because that much sky takes away from the beautiful expanse that is the cityscape.

That's an odd choice and makes the viewer confused as to your intention.\n\n\nThe line of the top of the wall to camera-left is positioned almost to the top of her head, but not quite. It pulls your attention to the hairline instead of the eyes.  Also, the way that it's positioned makes your model look short, while the way the photograph is framed makes your model look tall. It's a dissonance that will make the viewer uncomfortable though they won't know why.\n\n\nThe arm across the abdomen pose is easy to do but very hard to do well, and I'm afraid you fell into that trap here. By pointing the elbow towards the camera you foreshorten her forearm, especially when paired with a giant white watch. Her hand isn't awful, but it isn't great either. Also, the way her upper arm is positioned closest to the camera as a big mass of red sweater in a vertical column, especially when paired with her foreshortened forearm, emphasizes how thick it is, and \"thick\" is not usually a term you want to use when you're doing a female portrait like this.\n\n\nMore importantly, the way you have the red cardigan draped and her back hidden by the corner of the wall makes her look  shapeless and with a big ol' butt at the same time. We can't really see that she's got a waist.  Your model doesn't have to look like a sexpot or anything, but at the same time we want her to have some kind of shape. Right now the only shape we see is a big ol' upper arm and a very wide hip/buttock area.  Pull that cardigan back at the hips a little bit, or at least don't just let it sit there in a big blob. Combine that with more of an arched back and I think it would do wonders for her pose.  \n\nHer face here is also problematic. Try this as an exercise: Zoom in on the face and then use a piece of paper to cover the left side of her face and look only at the right. How does it look? Now cover the right and look only at the left. How does it look? Now look at them both together. See what I mean? Her face is naturally a little asymmetrical, and the way you have her posed and lit really emphasizes that a lot.

I'd love to see a little more light on the person and a bit more separation right around the feet. I also think it might be worth it to play with the color and white balance a bit more than you have. The green from those street lights is absolutely hideous. Perhaps with some color correction you could give the whole thing a more even blue tone, I love the look of the lights directly behind the subject in the fog.

The pose, the idea, the composition are all great. I feel like the location choice could be stronger though. As I said, I love the blue light directly behind the subject so those should definitely stay, and I do really like the old movie marquee to the left side. However I feel like the rest of the storefronts and stuff lining the street are kind of weak and hide in the shadows. I think if you went back and did the same shot but with some light painting (as a separate exposure to be masked in photoshop) up and down the street that would give it a slightly creepy, surreal quality that (I think) you are looking for. I find that if you can accent certain architectural elements that are interesting or odd with light touches of light from angles that it wouldn't normally be coming from (a tree lit as though from the headlights of an unseen approaching car, the cornicing on a building given a sharp highlight by lighting it from slightly behind, an odd glow coming from a shop window) creates a lack of continuity in the lighting that is unconsciously disconcerting to the viewer and helps create that odd, creepy dreamlike ambience.\n\nI hope this is helpful to you and if anything I said doesn't make sense just let me know!"], "label": 1, "image": ["2015-photocritique-submission_31zcex-image.jpeg"]}, {"text": ["Fine photo just not a clearly defined subject and composition.

So if you dont have a decent one, it should be very very high on your list of purchases. A lot of people seem to neglect a tripod, but other than camera and lens its probably the most important piece of equipment. As was also already said, f/1.4 is likely not a great choice here. Yes you get the most light, so you can get a fast enough shutter speed, but for landscapes where you can slow things down, shutter speed isnt really all that important.

Its hard to tell on the smaller preview sizes, but at full resolution its pretty clear that the whole background is out of focus.

And often in landscapes, getting everything in sharp focus is desirable.\n\nA few other \"housekeeping\" type of items. I am not 100% sure this is the case, but the image feels crooked.

Obviously use your own discretion from here on, but I'd recommend cropping the shore out just enough to bring that line of symmetry down so it just kisses your bottom thirds line, and then play around with cropping the sides in until something clicks for you. I'd start by trying the left side, but cropping out that little red dot would either mean leaving the bow of the ship kissing the frame, or you'd have to crop out a bunch of the bow to get a real balance.

If the picture were taken from the position i mentioned then the viewers will be forced to venture into the right part of the frame having established what's there to see on the left. Now with this picture the there are vaguely visible things to see on the left of the frame, like that red thing and one other boat.

The tall grass is kind of nice, but it takes up a really large portion of the frame and actually obscures quite a bit of background. The tree on the left, not doing anything for me, why is it there?

Why are the leaves essentially floating in from the left?\n\nWhat I see are some nice gentle rolling hills in the background off to the left and find myself wishing you had moved up closer to that road, found a nice foreground and used that road as a leading line to draw you into the frame and up to that nice sunset.\n\nAs far as the processing. I think it could use some work. Its got some pretty telltale signs of what everyone likes to call \"shitty hdr\" processing, whether you actually did HDR or not. To start, the brightness levels are just not quite right. The are around the sun is rather dark (and very heavily saturated) when it should be quite a bit brighter. But the bigger issue is the haloing, its rather noticeable around the trees, and it extends up to the sky at the top right corner, which is brighter than the sky in the middle of the frame.\n\nI think this is still a good candidate for some kind of HDR processing, but personally I think taking the time to bracket exposures and learn to manually blend them can produce better results pretty much every time than automated HDR tools (or simply overdoing the highlight/shadow recover).\n\nIts a nice landscape, but I think the photo could use work.

This light is really not good for waterfalls. Bright sunshine, especially in forested areas makes for very difficult waterfall photography because you have way too much dynamic range for the camera to handle.

It is a very common problem, so common that I have a copypasta to hand:\n\nWhen you look at a view, you have several senses working at once that all give you a complete sense of the world. You have two eyes giving you stereoscopic 3D vision and thus a sense of visual perspective and depth. You have peripheral vision, the smell of fresh air, the wind in your face, all giving you a sense of space. Then you raise the camera to your eye, take a shot, and all that is lost. You are compressing all that space into a 2D image. You have to do something to try and recapture that sense of space and depth.\n\nThere's not much you can do about the wind, the peripheral vision or the fresh air, but you *can* work on improving depth. The key is manipulating the different elements of the image to reintroduce that sense of perspective. If you frame a shot so that there are some flowers in the foreground and a mountain in the background, the viewer's brain, which *knows* that flowers are smaller than mountains, will automatically rebuild the scene in their mind's eye, depth and all.\n \nThat's right - a foreground. *So many* people neglect to include one. Not a proper one, anyway. There isn't one in this shot, because the angle at which you've taken the image (I'm guessing near eye level, looking straight across the water), means that the foreground is at your feet, and what foreground there is is more or less indistinguishable from the mid-ground.\n\nSo, try to introduce a foreground element - a rock, plants, a man-made object, a wall, whatever. If it forms a 'leading line' into the image, so much the better. You can do this by either getting lower, or using a wide angle and tilting the camera down. Try to think of a landscape photo as a story - it needs a beginning, middle, and end. It's your job to lead the viewer through the story. That's why leading lines are good - they direct the viewer's eye to where you want them to go.\n\nSo your beginning is the foreground. The middle ground is either the main part of the scene, or it is leading the viewer through to a stunning background, or perhaps both. The middle ground will hopefully contain some interesting elements like nice light, rocks, cats, or whatever, and should continue building the sense of perspective.\n\nAnd so to the end, the background. We can often lump the sky in here, unless the main subject of the shot *is* a spectacular sky. In many cases the background is the main subject of the image - for example, some spectacular mountains. You can often use the background to perpetuate that sense of depth, as things get smaller and more hazy with distance: it all helps the viewer's brain work out the scale of the scene they're looking at.\n\nTo try and illustrate what I mean, I've annotated one of my own landscape shots. It's by no means the best in the world, but hopefully it will give you an idea of where I'm coming from.

I also like the vaguely female nude impression in the netting between the escalators, like a renaissance painting back there (is it just me?)  \n\nThe black and red mess in the lowest gap between the stairs is either off-putting, or deliberate contrast.

Crop from the top. Locate the top of the blue diamond in the ceiling. That should be top dead center of the image. It is also the widest part of the dome, before it starts curving back in. Find exactly what works for you, some braces and arches will be cut off no matter what, as they are already, but this is the best place.  Consider cropping \n\n2. Remove three ugly off overhead devices:  \nRed camera in top right. Overhead light near top left of center escalator. Similar sensor on top right escalator.   \n\n3. Same for guard in booth to the left--leave him, just take out his coloring (desaturate) and he will disappear.\n \nFor next time, try hard to get it centered, not only placement of camera, but angle of camera too. Not a real big deal, but the center escalator is not centered, most noticeable in the foreground. \n\nBeautiful shot, keep up the good work and thanks for sharing  \n\n", "It's absolutely perfect. Love the color and the lighting.. but lots of credit is due to the architect imo, no offense to you. Again it's really great but it kind of follows the architecture in the way they intended.

If you're going to go for it, you need to absolutely nail the symmetry. Where the lines meet the edge of the frame, the proximity of the handrails to the edge of the frame, etc. I was going to suggest a long exposure to maybe try and get rid of the guy in the green vest, but forgot those escalators are moving. This actually could turn into a cool composite project. If you could get all the escalators at *exactly* the same position and clone/composite out the guy this could be amazing. Without doing that, you could desaturate his vest a bit so it's less noticeable.\n\nThe more I look at this the more I find to like. Even your watermark works. Well damn done. ", "Great shot dude!!

I would do this to separate the deer and the grass even more, making the deer stand out more.\n\nAlso, what would be interesting, would be capturing the deer looking at you which then connects the viewer more with the image and the main subject as it looks like the deer is peacefully staring into your soul.\n\nOtherwise, this is just my opinion, so if you don't like it, that's fine!

I have a 60d and don't really push it over 800. Low light + High ISO = noise. Noise reduces sharpeness.\n\nThe second is the lens. The 50mm 1.8 is a very economical lens and fun to shoot with, but its not the best quality glass. \n\nThird is the aperture. All lenses have a sweet spot where they are sharpest. Usually somewhere around F8.  Using the lens wide open at 1.8-2.4 will result in softer images. Additionally fully closing the aperture can cause diffraction (look it up) that can hurt the sharpness of an image. Every lens has a different sweet spot. You have to balance the sharpness you want with the dof you desire. \n\nTo remedy this in your current situation you can use and off camera flash to add more light to the scene. This way you can reduce the ISO and sharpen up the image.\n\nAlso if your image is underexposed and you bump it up in lightroom this can also add noise. I have found with my camera if I go up more that 1 stop on the raw file in lightroom that noise starts to become a problem.\n\nPost processing wont make these sharper. You could try for some noise reduction and adding some clarity, but you can only work with what's there. ", "As far as the images are concerned. They are nothing special. Not bad compositions, just not that great. Most people shoot photos of their cats, dogs or kids when they first get their camera so the internet is full of them.\nYou will have to do something really special to stand out and not look like everyone else that just got a camera.\n\nI'm guilty of it as well. I harass my dogs and cat all the time with my camera.\n\nHere is an example of a sharp image form my 60d. \nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/deglossed/6930499047/sizes/o/in/set-72157629123863621/\nThis was shot in my living room with studio strobes.  For the sharpest images you want to work at the sweet spot of your camera and lens.  ", "00wabbit definitely has some solid advice. You can figure out the sweet spot of a lens by either experimenting or looking it up online as some people may have already put in the work and posted results. \n\nI really appreciate that 00wabbit mentioned 'off camera'. There is a reason why the higher end cameras don't have a built-in flash; they are crap for a number of reasons which I don't think I'll get into, but positioning is one of the bigger ones.\n\nIt is kind of hard for me to give critique on how you could improve these as I don't know the shutter speed of any of the shots as that can also factor into the lack of sharpness. \n\n*[Composition/Technique]*\n\nFor all images the background is no good. It is common place and doesn't help the foreground object. Nothing wrong with taking photos in your home, but either finding a better background or making one (or just having a plain color behind) could help. \n\n**Image #1**\n\nNot bad composition, although I'd probably crop/rotate it a bit if possible. Your lines look pretty straight, but I think they might be a bit off (due to imgur I know it has no exif data and I don't find it worth downloading if I can't view the exif in this situation). It may also just be due to the imbalance at the bottom where the head of the cat is almost touching the edge of the frame, but the paws are not. I *think* this might be fixed/helped with rotating a bit, but again I didn't take the time. Either way, due to whatever it is I find that it is distracting and doesn't lead the eyes as well as it should.\n\nThe image is entirely too dark. The blacks of the cat just blend in too much and it seems as there is no color information. More light, but you know this already. \n\n**Image #2**\n\nLighting is a bit better than #1, but still an issue. The composition of this image doesn't work in my opinion. The cat's face isn't put in a location that leads the eyes well.\n\n**Image #3**\n\nWay too dark and the background is very distracting. The comp is decent, but the background on the left is distracting as. Black with some white stuff behind the ear of the cat. Knowing what is in your entire frame is important in most situations. \n\n\n**Image #4**\n\nProbably my favorite of the pack, but riddled with all of the same issues of too dark and bad background. Also the cat has an odd expression. One eye larger and the mouth is at an awkward angle? Maybe your cat is trying to do a sexy lip bite. :P\n\nAnd since I don't want to be outdone by 00wabbit I'll also share a photo of mine.

Also, the wedge shape of the ground (wider at the right) makes the geometry feel a little off, when it isn't, really.  \n\n\nWithout retaking the photo, you might be able to improve it by choosing a more purposeful point of origin in the frame, either thirds or square in the middle.

Another option is to use the lamp as a motivated light source but only in appearance, it's not really the true light source, so you could have another flash somewhere out of frame pointed at you and you would be free to move the lamp around a little more leniently as it wasn't the True Light Source but just the appearance in the exposure. \n\nWell-executed but for an overall image most people would want to see some more separation from the background a little bit more detail on camera left but of course to keep with your theme that would involve another motivated light source.

That or you have a very dark exposure when it could potentially be brighter. Colors pop with either saturation or contrast. Saturation looks fine, but the contrast of this image is lacking, its just too dark in my opinion. I can see some splashes of light falling in the shot, on the boat, on the waves, on the little island in the background, but none of those things are really highlighted because of the darkness of the image. If you are happy with the overall brightness level my suggestion would be to do some dodging and burning, specifically dodge some of those things I just mention, maybe even with some color to help them pop too. Just be careful since they are crowding the edge and the brighter those get, the more it will take away from the whole flow of the image.\n\nAnd that brings me to the composition. It could use some work. The sky isnt adding much to the shot here yet it occupies a full 2/3 of the shot, all the interesting bits are at the bottom making the bottom feel very crowded. On top of that, the two strongest visual elements besides the walkway are the boat at the island, and they are both pushed way out to the edge of the frame, which as I said earlier breaks up the flow of the image a bit especially if they were to be brighter or have their highlights enhanced. Add to it, the boat is cut off by the edge on the left as the island is obscured partially by a less interesting island (less interesting due to no visible light on it). And the walkway itself is ever so slightly off centered. Not in a way that feels deliberate, in a way that feels like you wanted it to be centered, but just missed the mark.\n\nThe colors are very nice though so good job there, but if you play with the exposure and contrast, but careful that you dont end up oversaturating thing.\n\nTwo final notes.\n\nFirst, the horizon is ever so slightly crooked.\n\nSecond, I have to mention it.

And if you are worried about people stealing your images, you would be much better served by only ever posting small web sized images instead of the full resolution.

In the normal range you would have that hue clock pointing to between 12:00 and 2:00.\n\nAdjusting the image to reduce the blues made the greens look awful so I had to adjust them as well  The Idea is to reduce the hue clock numbers to as near zero as possible without making the image look crappy.

There is the 'negative relationship', the juxtaposition of red umbrella against monochrome of church of course but this is perhaps a little too obvious; ('here's a bright red umbrella against a grey church') the answer is effectively handed to the viewer on a plate and we quickly move on.

If that's the case, here's what I can critique:\n\n1. Composition.  You've done two things that distract my eye in this portrait.  The first is that you've got your model leaning uncomfortably diagonally through the frame, and the second is the fence planks are skewed in the opposite diagonal.  This is visually confusing and does not lead the eye well.  The fence looks pretty cool looking.  Use it in a way that leads the viewers eye across it to your subject.  Finally, your angle is somewhere between \"straight on\" and \"straight down\" the wall, making me wonder which one you really meant to choose.  Because her lean is neither perpendicular or parallel to the fence, it feels awkward.  \n\n2. Lighting.  You chose a good time of day.  Looks like the golden hour.  However, it appears you're fighting against how the light fell on the model, rather than using it.  I can't tell for sure but it looks like you have fill-flash on the model, but it's just barely off.  That may also be light-wash from the fence, which you wouldn't have if the model was back against the fence as mentioned previously in item 1.  Finally, her hair created some odd shadows across the face, and could've been swept behind the ear or cheek.\n\n3. Posing.  I don't have too much here, but perhaps it would've been better to be either closer or further away, depending on creative vision.  In this space, you've cut off her arms right at the elbows and torso, which is generally a \"no no\" in composition (don't cut the frame off at the joints). \n\nAnyway - just my two cents.  ", "Great colors and skin tones here!  I also like that you've gotten creative with the angle from which you're shooting. It's definitely not boring.\n\nI see a few things that could be improved upon. First the subject seems to be \"leaning out\" of the frame -- not just her angle but the flow of her posture and her gaze is out of the photo. I know rules are meant to be broken, but having a subject looking toward the \"empty\" space in the frame seems to me to work much better as it doesn't draw the eyes out of the frame. \n\nWhile the lighting is fine, i do see some shadow on her face that could have been prevented by facing her more toward the light, also solving the first issue I pointed out.\n\nWhen I started taking portraits I always looked for \"interesting\" backgrounds. You've definitely found one. But I think when I see the absolute best portraits, the background serves to accentuate the mood rather than be interesting in its own right. To that end, I'd suggest moving the subject off the wall. I know the leaning look is nice and casual but I think the graffiti is too prominent, serving almost as a second subject. Blurring it out as Bokeh could have made it a nice but non-distracting background element instead while still giving the more urban feel to this portrait. \n\nGreat work! Hope my thoughts help.

Where along the blue ridge parkway was this?\n\nI think my biggest critiques here would be that the composition feels a bit disjointed to me. I love shots that include the road, but I am not really sure its all that well incorporated. Its just kind of an angled component that cuts across the image. Would love to some curves of the road and have it actually lead into the image instead of just cutting across it at the bottom. The rock at the bottom left also isnt really the most interesting. The orange-ish moss or lichen or whatever provides some good color contrast with the rest, but I am just not sure its really an interesting enough foreground object. It feels to a small degree like you were really just looking for something to stick in the foreground even though it may not work completely with the background.\n\nYou mention you didn't really get the colors you were hoping for. I know that feeling all too well. That said, I think maybe you pushed things slightly too far trying to bring those colors out. I realize they are the blue ridge for a reason, but some of the blues in the distant mountains seem maybe boosted a little much, and some of the almost light purples dont quite feel 100% natural. That said, its done tastefully, so I think it works well here.\n\nBe carefuly about your sky. Your highlights up to the right look like they may be blown a little in places, but also pulled back. They are kind of dully and gray. And I would say you actually have some more room to pull some color out there if you were so inclined.\n\nBe careful with shadow recovery too or whatever technique you may have used for dynamic range (if thats what you did). The mountains just above the closer trees are brighter at the bottom than they are up towards the top. Its especially noticeable towards the left of the frame where the mountains almost seem like they are glowing near the bottom before returning to a normal brightness level near the top. Says to me that You likely were playing with the exposure to keep the background exposed well vs the foreground. Again, just be careful with it.\n\nMy suggestion if you want to get more creative with things. Add some glow/haze to the upper right.

First of all, when taking a shot like this, give it a good thought about what your aim is: do you want to show the statue within its context, do you want to isolate the statue? Do you want have a documentary photo or do you want it to be artistic or visually pleasing. In this case of the statue you could maybe look for examples on the net and try to replicate something you like. \n\nComposition-wise, this shot can be improved. There\u2019s distracting stuff on the right side. Cropping it out will improve the photo a little. Since your subject is not running away (it\u2019s a statue, obviously) and it\u2019s at your house, try to experiment with different composition while shooting. \n\nThe settings you used are not optimal, unless you used a tripod, but even then. 1/13s handheld won\u2019t give you good sharpness at 35mm. An easy rule to remember is to keep you shutter speed at the same number as your focal length. Since you shot at 35mm, your lowest speed should be 1/35s. The greater the focal length the greater the speed. So at 200mm your minimum shutter speed should be 1/200s (although at higher focal length it is often safe to use the focal length multiplied by 1,5 or even 2. So at 300mm, a safe shutter speed, ensuring sharp shots would be 1/600mm. This is all for handheld shots and doesn\u2019t apply for shots on a tripod. Although, many lenses have stabilization nowadays, meaning that you could get sharper shots using lower speeds for a given focal length, my advice to any beginner is to not use it and learn how to get sharp shots without technological assistance. \n\nAlso, for such a shot I don\u2019t think an aperture of f/20 is necessary. Looking at the picture I have the impression that f/8 or f/11 are sufficient to cover the depth of field of the statue. Greater aperture means you get more light through the lens, meaning that you could lower the ISO (lower ISO\u2019s are generally better) or have a greater shutter speed. There\u2019s many apps and tools online that can help you calculate depth of field for any given distance/focal length composition. Always interesting to have a look at this and how depth of field varies when changing the settings. \n\nGreat starter effort I\u2019d say, keep on shooting and learning. You\u2019ll quickly notice that shots you find ok or good today, don\u2019t make the cut anymore months later as your technique and vision has evolved. \n\nAnother thing, the best way to improve your photography, is to look at many photos, and find some photographers that you like and \u2018study\u2019 their work. \n\nHope this helps.

My critiques are in a couple choices made during the shoot and a couple after.\n\nThe rim lighting on her hair is great, but why is the background behind her head so well lit? I understand if it was an unavoidable side effect of the shooting location, but losing that detail would really focus the eye on the model's face (not that you haven't done that well here, but the effect would be increased). The pinching of her waist by her top is another issue. Love the pose, and a different top would accentuate her phenomenal body more than that one. Given the solid colors everywhere else (the clothes on the rack, her shorts, the background and foreground), the patterned top again pulls the eye away from her face. \n\nOthers have mentioned the chromatic aberration, which is an issue.\n\nPost processing wise, i would have spent a little more time on her face. It is a great face, she has wonderful lips and the single eye is a great focus point. A little extra sharpening on the eye and lips, some work (I would use frequency separation) to kill the bag under her eye would do wonders.\n\nThe rim lighting also highlights some unfortunate hairs on her (camera) left leg that can be eliminated pretty easily. The frayed front on the bottoms is most noticeable at her crotch, which is unfortunate. Looks mildly reminiscent of out of control bush. Another issue that could be eliminated in post.

Lots of people call that you subject so it can get confusing.

Without it, people will glance at you photo and move on. Pay attention to how your eyes move around the photo. For example, if you have a good leading line does it lead to something interesting to look at?\n\nWhen you take a photo ask yourself what do I want people to see? What am I trying to show them?\n\nWhen I glance at this my eyes wander around the photo looking for something to look at. Since I wasn't there, I don't have any emotions toward the photo so it doesn't have any meaning to me.\n\nYour Point of Interest needs to be prominent in the photo. When you take the photo ask yourself, what do I want the people to see? Then focus on that and make it stand out in the frame. Look around the frame at everything else you are about to capture and not just what ever caught you attention. Backgrounds Matter!

Obscuring the eyes in a portrait can be a really interesting move, but it's one of those things where it's better done in a more intentional manner. (I hope that makes sense. A physical barrier vs focus.) I had a teacher when I was starting out who had a mantra: Good design is clear and specific. I think it translates well to the elements in a photograph.

Nowhere is the defining quality of the bench - its absolute immovability - felt more powerfully than at a bus or train station\u2026 To sit down on the bench means to give in, to accept the reality of the situation, to succumb, in fact, to the intolerable benchness of the situation.\"*\n\nIn terms of tips I think it's difficult to beat the simple but very effective advice given by Denise Wolff: 'Before pressing the shutter button remember to ask yourself: *What is my subject here?

It's undoubtedly pretty scenery, but it isn't a remarkable portrayal. It's too wide-angle to be focused on the mountains, but there isn't anything interesting enough in the foreground to merit the wide angle. The sky is too formless to be interesting, but the foreground lacks shape as well. There's no clear subject.

I don't think this photo is a *truly great* image, but it's a starting point. I've seen mountains and clouds before, but this photo shows me clouds and mountains from a unique perspective; something I can't achieve with my own two eyes: the perspective of time.

This, to me, is a truly great photo and it hits on all three criteria. It's something I've never seen before. I mean sure, I've seen mountains before, but not like these. They're foreign and craggy and mysterious and epic. And the perspective is unique as well; most mountains I've seen have been viewed from below, me standing at the bottom looking upward. These are greeted from eye level, and with a stunning light that's almost ethereal. And it tells a story. That lone boat; what is it doing out here in this alien world? Why is it alone, sailing through this sunset? Why did it swerve? Is there something to the right of the frame? A small village? The ocean? More emptiness to explore?\n\nYou see my point.

Using photoshop and curves I was able to expand the range of yellows in the scene and increase the saturation of the reds and greens.

Go shoot more.", "Not totally clear on the why of the shot, which makes comments on the how a little more difficult. \n\nFirst, I want to note the composition is really solid\u2014I might go with just a little less sky, but it\u2019s got a nice balance, and the model poses really connect clearly. \n\nFrom there, just to run through it and make sure I\u2019m getting what you\u2019re trying to put across: You\u2019ve got two nude women, with poses that convey fearful(remorseful?) supplicant and divine favor; their nudity contrasts with harsh desert, and the desert evokes Biblical themes over classical antiquity. Their faces are both covered with windblown shrouds\u2014anonymizing their identity, which makes them more objects, less subjects. They also evoke ghosts (spiritual + death). \n\nYou say you want a Renaissance vibe, but unless there\u2019s an allusion that I\u2019m missing, but part of what distinguishes the Renaissance is literally the narrative symbolism. \n\nWhat it reminds me of more is the neoclassicism of the \u201890s, the kind from Madonna videos and perfume ads. For the Renaissance, the formalism was connected with widespread knowledge of a canon; with the \u201890s, that iconography wasn\u2019t as immediate and there were both pushes to use the same elements as more personally centered narratives and as ever more abstracted universal symbolism. \n\nSo, I\u2019m reading kind of a pastiche of symbolism without a clear coherence\u2014universal woman as human? We\u2019re in a hell and redemptive grace only comes after death? \n\nAll of that is frankly a lot of conceptual work for an audience, and what makes some of eg neoclassical Mapplethorpe work is an incredible sumptuousness of media. Those palladium prints make simple flowers look amazing. \n\nIt\u2019s currently in a really realist mode; if you want to emphasize this as a personal narrative, emphasizing mystery and subjectivity will help. If the goal is more a universalist abstraction, honestly, I\u2019m not sure what edits I\u2019d lean toward there because you\u2019re pretty much there and it\u2019s more that the symbols you\u2019ve emphasized seem a bit muddled.\n\nMore mid tone, more shadow, more edge contrast, I\u2019d play with that.", "can you post the color version?", "I'd probably Photoshop out the shadow penis...", "It\u2019s fine.

It indeed is a bit moody, but not 'dreadful' - more 'hopeful' with how the light comes in. \n\nRegarding the HDR, I think there's room for improvement there. What were the settings for your bracketed exposures? The reason I ask is that although the shadow detail seems fine, the sky is still completely blown out. This means the exposures either weren't blended well, or the highlight exposure was still underexposed.  You added some kind of gradient brush or vignette at the top of the image, but this only darkened the sky without adding back any detail. Additionally, there's some ghosting along the tree trunks, especially the closest tree on the left. Did you use a tripod, and did you time your shot to be between gusts of wind? (Trees can still move a surprising amount the higher up you look.) Consider using automatic de-ghosting if your software allows for it - Lightroom has an option for this during the HDR merge. \n\nSomething else, there's pretty heavy chromatic aberration where the sky is visible through the tree branches. You might want to remove this in future edits - usually it's just ticking a box. \n\nThe fern colors are not really accurate, but you could argue that's a stylistic choice. The current color is close enough to teal to complement the orange, so you might want to leave it as-is. \n\nI think your shot captures the mood reasonably well, but some technical details are holding it back from its fullest potential. Don't be afraid to go for more extreme bracketing (+- 1.5 or even 2 stops) if the situation calls for it. On location, take some test shots on-site to find the right exposure for shadows, midtones and highlights before moving on to the final capture. In editing, make sure to catch the details such as CR and ghosting. \n\nBest of luck!", "I think it would be way better without the white lines around it.

It's on a bed, but it's not really a \"sexy bed\" shot. Seems to be taken slightly wide angle, which isn't particularly flattening to the facial features (classic portraiture is usually slightly telephoto). The lighting isn't very strong, and it doesn't particularly sculpt the face or do much of anything ... it's just ... there.\n\nGoogling around for examples:\n\nhttps://www.masterfile.com/image/en/846-03163392/1940s-bored-serious-boy-waiting-chin-resting-in-hands\n\nSee how this has a strong directional light, and the background fades to black?

Blemishes in the skin are emphasized here, rather than de-emphasized. The face and arms are textured in a way that is more typical for male portraiture than studio portraits of women. \n\nTo me the biggest problem is the lighting. It's not very bright, so it leaves the whole image with a low-contrast muddiness that doesn't really work for me. It's the lighting more than anything that makes it look like a snapshot more than any kind of professional studio portrait. \n\nHope this helps? Maybe try using windowlight instead of an incandescent bulb, to start with, and maybe a sheet or some kind of background?

I get what time of day it is and how little light there is to capture the concept. With your equipment it may not have been possible to easily get what you needed. A strobe goes a very long way and even something like a cheap (or a few) Vivitar 285HV go a very, very, very long way. You mix them with some cheap knock off wireless triggers and you can utterly transform shots like this. The next step would be multiple exposures. You would likely need at least three as I see it. One for the background/roof which would likely need a very steady hand, solid object, or tripod to get, but darks like this need to be intentional or done post process. Second would need to be one about like this specifically for his shadow, and a third with a strobe or two to light him up at a decently quick shutter speed to stop his movement and have him clear, sharp, and in focus. Sorry for bunching all of these together, but I feel they're all interlinked. \n\n* **Distractions**\n * The wires on the right are a minor distraction. The frame needs to be cropped, brought in, or edited out in my opinion. The subject isn't centered on the roof well. The distance of the dual pipings on the right and left leave him off center which cause minor distractions for the eyes and leave the image feeling a bit off balance. Or you could intentionally have made this off center and instead of putting him right in the middle you could have had him on the left or right of the third part of the image. A couple of the puddles on the right are a bit dark and also a bit distracting and add to the overall imbalance of the image. While all of these things are minor, they can add up and have a big effect on an image. *EDITED IN:* Also, the treeline should be entirely silhouetted IMO. Would also help in taking away from the image with the almost details that are left. I would also remove the light from the streetlights in the back way off in the distance. Again, small things, but each one adds up.\n\n* **Color**\n * The colors are a bit muted for me, this is an image that should op more and I'd probably increase the red in the center a bit and add a stronger blue to the rest of the sky while making the red on the right a bit more muted. I would probably toy with making the red on the right blue as well (in the sky and the reflection on the roof) just to continue with the theme of drawing the eyes toward your subject and away from distraction.\n\n**In Summary**\n\nI love the concept, I think it is fantastic. While it isn't entirely unique, it is your own and uncommon for sure. I think you captured the jump well and he posted well. That whole aspect of the capture is great to me, but the rest just falls a bit short. Again, the primary issue here is lack of a flash/strobe, a way to capture your subject and have him lit properly. That would utterly revolutionize this image. Hell, I've used shop spotlights in a pinch before, and it works (gonna have to do color corrections in post, but sometimes you just work with what you've got). So, 10/10 on the concept, but the execution could use a little work and maybe a few tools to aid the process for that perfect shot. It is a shame that a shot like this will be hard to come by to retake though. Not everyday you get lighting like that. Thanks for sharing and keep it up.", "You needed a lot more light to turn this into a silhouette image, and it also doesn't help that his knees downward are below the horizon.  If you can't change the location, then get down as low as you can photographing him.  It would have improved the image in many ways: better intersection with the light, less intersection with the horizon, appearance of a higher jump, a more dramatic effect.\n\nAs is, you should crop out much of what you don't need, as the scene has too many distracting elements on the left and right.", "In post I might increase the exposure around the subject and above him to make him stand out more and give the impression that he's being beamed up to the mothership. ", "Biggest point of critique here is that its just too dark. You mention somewhere going for a silhouette look, but the subject is too bright and the background is too dark for that. So, if you are going for that silhouette, make it a real silhouette and play up the brightness and intensity of that background. Otherwise, recover your shadows a bit and let your subject \\(the person\\) actually be the subject of the shot.\n\nAs for the edits, you gotta be careful with whatever you did in the sky. You pulled those highlights back or toned the saturation down and now it looks like you almost have some posterization or something going on in the highlights in the sky. The color gradient is really not smooth and has this weird purple outline.\n\nAs far as composition, I think you were on the right track, but this misses the mark for me. Mainly because the whole image is suggesting that we look up, yet you have half the frame full of the roof of this building, there are some random pipes sticking up and some wires on the left that really pull focus away from where it should be.\n\nTechnically the image is lacking too, since you did provide a high res, its easy to see that the whole thing is either out of focus or there was camera shake \\(hard to tell\\), but the end result is that the whole image is soft.\n\nIts a nice concept overall, even though its not necessarily the most unique \\(but then again, what is these days...\\), but I find myself wishing the image popped more, you toned back that pop and I wanna see it.

There are multiple things technically wrong with this(color balance, depth of field, level, etc.). However, this scene has A LOT going for it. This guy looks so interesting, his beard is awesome! I would have recommended asking him to take 4-5 steps forward(if possible) and shoot him with a shallow depth of field so the background crates are out of focus. Usually older people have a lot of character in their face(as this guy does) and black and white images usually help convey more of that character than a normal color image. Right now all I see is his blinding red shirt. If this was a completely staged shot for photography purposes, it would have been beneficial to add some custom lighting, making it look like there was a directional overhanging light above/in front of him. He looks to be in some kind of warehouse, so that lighting would provide a little more dingy/dramatic feel. I don't know your experience level, but I assume it has to be a beginner(no offense).

Your subject(the man?), while interesting, has the same apparent depth of field as the rest of the rather busy background. Otherwise, he and the background have no separation and no depth. I'm assuming this was shot at maybe F11-13.

I was reading read some comments and, as interesting as they are, I'd go for an opposite approach - more minimalism, less enhancing on the \"overall image\" and a little effort to make the man and his pipe pop up a little more. The clouds could get a little enhancing, too! Here's how I would work with your picture:  \n\n\nYour **composition** is fine: the fact that the kite and person are aligned make it very pleasant. For the rest of the pic, it's important to remember that *negative space is a tricky thing to play with*. Some comments advised you to leave less negative space (being closer to the person, etc.). Honestly, I think your pic gets way more impacting as it is now: all the negative space leads the viewer's eye to both the kite and the man, giving them more impact on the overall image.  \n\n\nAbout your **camera settings**: You took this pic with f/1.8 and 1/4000 seconds. With a ***smaller aperture*** (think about f/6, f/8 and upwards), you could extract more details from the man and his kite. The clouds could get a little more detailed, too. In a B&W photo, contrast and details can really pump up your pic and make it richer. Of course, that would leave you with less light, but you could balance it with a ***slower speed*** (think 1/400, 1/800, for example). Really, there's no need for such a high speed in this case: you could make it slower and get pretty much the same image.  \n\n\nAbout **post-producing**, I'd go for B&W, since the scenario doesn't seem to offer a colorful scene. Since the guy on the bottom seems to be \"blurred\" (or, maybe, out of focus), you could leave him darker, almost making it impossible to distinguish the man from his sweater. The clouds could have a little more contrast/detail: it would balance the contrast between the man (and his pipe) and the plain sky. For the kite, maybe contrast wouldn't fit - it already steals a lot of attention. But it would be nice to see it sharper and detailed, as it's \"drawings\" seem quite beautiful.  \n\n\nP.S.: If I'd took this picture, I'd imagine it as a Wallpaper (for smartphones and/or any screen that can fit it). If there's enough quality, even a nice poster could be made!\n\n  \nP.S.2: Kudos for you trying street photography, takes a lot of guts!

Until now I've always just used the few minutes around sunset or sunrise as I didn't have any filters. My uncle gifted me a filter kit and so I set out to see what I could achieve. Overall I'm happy with the results but I'm not too keen on the texture of the sky and how it just fades into the orange of the horizon.\n\nI'm also red green colourblind, so there may be some problems with the colours.\n\nCanon EOS 750D, 18-55 mm kit lens @55mm f/20 ISO100, shutter speed doesn't seem to be included in Google photos info but it's about 3s\n\nI used an ND6 graduated filter and a pinkish orange graduated filter", "As others have mentioned, f20 means the sharpness of the photo is degraded by diffraction limits of the camera/lens combination. You may want to us no smaller than f8 and add ND filters if you want longer exposure.\nAs to improving what you've shot already, I recommend increasing the brightness of the wave foam in the foreground to give more \"pop\".\nOtherwise great job!", "Balance between sky and the rocks in terms of lighting is pretty okay,\nIn my experience back when i was experimenting with long-exposures, using the same lens, is that you dont want set the aperture too small, above f/11 the quality starts to drop, and actually decreases the sharpness. For a comp like this id use f/9-f/11 and perhaps try focus stacking. \nAlso, since you are stacking filters already, maybe add a few more stops of ND filter to lengthen your exposure time to around 10-20 seconds, gives a much smoother water result, as here with just 3 secs is not quite there in terms of smoothness imo\n\nHope this helps!", "For me it's a fantastic shot. It's well balanced, good composition and great scene. I love it", "So to start, I think you did a good job with this overall. The swirl of a wave at the bottom is nice and definitely works well as a leading line, but I also feel theres something missing. You have an interesting foreground (though it could use some more color, its very brown), and then its just kind of missing a background. The colors in the sky also dont really look right to me. The orange is fine, but the pink/purple just doesnt look real. The brightness levels of the sky and foreground also dont seem to match. Either the foreground is a bit too bright or the sky is a bit too dark.\n\nYou have some quality issues too. The image is quite noisy. If I had to guess, you underexposed this and then pulled it up in post? It also looks like you applied some sharpening on it thats bringing the noise pattern out even more. Since a lot of the noise is in more uniform areas, you should be able to do some noise reduction and handle it fairly well.\n\nIts also hard to tell if there was some camera shake as things just look ever so slightly soft. So usual advice applies, make sure you are using a good tripod, and use mirror lockup and a cable release. It could also be in part to a less than optimal depth of field as the rocks farther back look less sharp than the rocks up close. Though at f/20, its possible that you may have just front focused, or it could be due to being diffraction limited from stopping down too far. Personally I wouldnt stop that far down, as I prefer to stay around f/8-f/11 for landscapes and only stop down more in a pinch. You may find though at 55mm that you will struggle with depth of field, so, trade offs. Or look to doing something like focus stacking if you need. Assuming you care about pixel perfect sharpness, which honestly depending on what you plan to do with the image likely wont matter.\n\nFor the water, an even longer shutter speed may be optimal to really get it silky smooth. Instead of stopping down that far to help get a longer shutter speed, look instead to stacking filters or using a darker filter.\n\nCouple other minor things...

", "Try this: http://imgur.com/MiQlIIN\n\nOne big thing that I've learned is that a dark color even when full saturated or vibranted (thats not a word) won't pop. The pop comes from the brightness of the subject. Since the picture is somewhat underexposed I brought up the overall exposure by .46. Just so you know, there's no logic behind that number, I just eyed it and when it looked natural I stopped. You mentioned that you didn't want to blow out the highlights so I brought them down a bit. I didn't want to bring them too far down because that seemed to be affecting the colors in the top of the building. Since most of the building is in shadow especially near the base, I brought that up a bit as well. Lastly I used both saturation and vibrance to get that \"pop\" you were talking about. I was a little conservative, I wanted to keep it natural while still highlighting the colors but if you want even more \"pop\" then definitely try increasing the exposure, adding a bit of contrast, and even saturating the image even more. It all comes down to your taste.\n\nThese are all relatively simple changes but learning how to use everything on the \"Basic\" tab can make a massive change to your photography.

There is legit nothing wrong with the building that the rest of the background isn't doing. Of course we're going to look at the background after looking at the light, it's just as important as the light if not more important as it's really selling the entire mood.

I think its a subset of landscape photography that doesnt get quite as much love as it should.\n\nSo, with this one, I think the main thing that I am not a huge fan of are those foreground bushes. I know the traditional wisdom in a landscape is to have a strong foreground element, but I find that in telephoto landscapes its often very difficult to pull off or do well. And in this one, they are nearly obscuring your subject. It kind of works as a framing device, but you also now have a large portion of the image that is out of focus. And I often think that in image framing elements often just get in the way. Likely best to just not include them at all. In my opinion of course.\n\nI also think the light here is just kind of bland. You say this is a test shot, so, fine. But better light is always always your friend. The major benefit here though are those clouds, the low clouds especially. Those are great, and should potentially be more of the star of the image. To that, I wonder if maybe a landscape orientation with none of the foreground bushes and less of the sky might have been better.\n\nProcessing here isnt really doing anything for me though. The mountains are unnaturally bright and unnaturally blue. I would also venture a guess and say you pulled a gradient filter down to darken the sky. Its a nice idea, but I think the implementation needs work as the middle of the photo just looks brighter than it should and then theres a bit of an unnatural brightness fade as you move up the image.

What are you trying show us? What was the intent of your photo?  One of the key point of good composition is Most photos need a good clear focal point and this one doesn\u2019t have a focal point.\n\nLet me start by defining some terminology.\n\n**Your subject** should be thought of as what you wanted to show, what you were looking at or what specifically you want people to notice..\n\n**Point of interest** is what your eyes are drawn to and holds you attention. Lots of people call that you subject so it can get confusing. A point of interest CAN be the subject but doesn\u2019t have to be the intended subject.\n\nA Focal Point is important because your eye needs a place to rest and something to hold your attention. Without it, people will glance at you photo and move on. Pay attention to how your eyes move around the photo. For example, if you have a good leading line does it lead to something interesting to look at?\n\nWhen you take a photo ask yourself what do I want people to see? What am I trying to show them?\n\nWhen I glance at this my eyes wander around the photo looking for something to look at. Since I wasn't there, I don't have any emotions toward the photo so it doesn't have any meaning to me.\n\nYour Point of Interest needs to be prominent in the photo. When you take the photo ask yourself, what do I want the people to see? Then focus on that and make it stand out in the frame.

The little pieces of lint/dust on the glass stand out, and make it look like a rushed shot.\n\nThird, and final for styling, is using a light to cause some glare off the watch face.

If you use some light reflection to \"cover\" that part of the watch, it would look more intentional to me.  \n\n\nOther than that, while the resolution and sharpness aren't what I would expect from something out of a magazine, but better that what I normally see from a phone. It's nice to see someone who can use their phone's camera well! I would *like* to see more sharpness, but that's probably just the phone's camera limitation. The contrast helps (and that it's in monochrome), but a DSLR or mirrorless will give you more resolution while a good lens will give you a much sharper image.\n\nAnd if I sound overly-critical of the small stuff it's just because it's a good shot, and there aren't any bigger critiques that I noticed.

You just have to work on your execution. Don\u2019t give up! You\u2019re going to have to shoot with models *a lot* to get the hang of posing, and to find your groove in terms of poses that work for capturing the mood/feel you\u2019re going for. \n\nThere\u2019s some gatekeeping happening in the comments with all the \u201cyou have to study more\u201d shit. Yes, definitely get yourself on Pinterest. Search for fashion images/poses you like. Make a gallery of poses you want to try. BUT: Bring them on a SHOOT. \n\n\u201cStudying\u201d an image is good for understanding what works, but the only way you\u2019re going to get better is to shoot more, shoot more, shoot more. \n\nI can tell you where I think this image needs improvement:\n\nFirst off, when you\u2019re working with a garment with lines like the pants, you have to be OBSESSIVELY conscientious of what those lines are doing in the frame and to the model\u2019s body. The way you have her seated here, the lines are all over the place. You\u2019ve disrupted the cleanliness of the lines. Stand her up, or find a way to elongate her more if you insist on her sitting. \n\nNext, the way you have her seated isn\u2019t flattering for her midsection. The garment is bunching up there, and her posture isn\u2019t the most flattering for her back and midsection. Make sure your models are elongating their spines, tucking their lower backs, dropping the shoulders back, etc. This is a good starting point to improve your posing tenfold without having to do much else. Just be careful that it doesn\u2019t look too rigid.\n\nWork on leg placement. One leg is cropped off, and the other one comes across the bottom of the frame at a flat angle and then bends away. Her shoe is floating behind her thigh - the eye can\u2019t make sense of whether it\u2019s attached to her or not. This disrupts the model\u2019s physical \u201ccontinuity\u201d so to speak. \n\nThe hand placement needs to be more intentional. It\u2019s placed there but it\u2019s passive and the colour of her nails is pulling my eyes away from other elements in the photo. She\u2019s also forgotten to take her hair tie off her wrist. You know what\u2019s quicker than having to cleanly photoshop that out? Her taking it off her wrist on set. Always fix that sort of thing on set whenever you can. \n\nHer left arm is cutting across her bust, which can work for certain poses/models. At the angle you\u2019re shooting, it\u2019s not particularly flattering. \n\nI know you\u2019re happy with your choice of location/background, but you should spend way more time on your model\u2019s posing and mood they\u2019re conveying. That\u2019s the difference-maker. A blank wall with a well-posed, striking image of a model beats a great location with a flat model 10/10 times IMO. \n\nShe\u2019s got interesting features, I\u2019d want to see her face without sunglasses. When you\u2019re starting out, props can be a kind of crutch to enhance an otherwise flat image. Try to avoid them whenever possible. Push yourself to work with the model to bring the attitude out of them. Props are easy, energy is hard. \n\nDon\u2019t get discouraged. Working with models is a challenge. All the best shooters were exactly where you are now at some point. Stick with it, and remember that you\u2019re the director of the shoots you do; have a clear vision to refer to going in. Know what you\u2019re chasing and figure out a way to get there. \n\nGood luck, hit me up with any questions.", "If you want to make it you have to study how to pose your models", "You have body parts cut off.

It looks like you are in an outdoor environment during the day which leaves me very confused about the settings you chose to shoot at. I'm going to assume you were using a Sigma 50mm f/1.4 and I have to wonder why you didn't shoot at f/1.4 and ISO 100, especially as you mentioned you were having trouble separating the dog from the background in post. Shooting at f/1.4 adds significantly more light into the sensor which means you don't have to use such a high ISO and also adds more bokeh (blurred out of focus areas). You also didn't mention your shutter speed but f/1.4 is 4 stops more light than f/4 and ISO 100 is 4 stops less light then ISO 800, meaning they cancel each other out (roughly) and you could still use the same shutter speed.\n2. I think you did a good job of capturing a \"serious\" emotion with Coco and I think the side profile with Coco looking away really matches the emotion in the image. However, the background is a bit distracting, especially those bright roses. Either shooting with a f stop like f/1.4(see above point) or moving Coco away from the leaves would really help \"dissolve\" the background and pull the viewers focus towards Coco.\n3. This image feels muted, like its a raw file straight out of camera and I think it feels that way because there is little contrast throughout the image, there are no blacks or whites to really add some punchy contrast and make Coco's black fur deep in color and the leaves and collar pop. Honestly, just pulling the contrast slider will give you a close to perfect effect imo. You've done a great job exposing this image but all of the information is sitting in the middle of the histogram, and there are no areas sitting in the extreme bright spots or shadows.\n\nI'm not sure how experienced you are so I apologize if 3 is explained poorly and feel free to ask for a more in depth explanation.

Don't overspend on a camera, basic model from any maker is fine.\nInstead spend a bit more in a nice lense. To learn better, do not get a zoom, instead get a 35mm or a 20~mm(with a crop sensor camera), this way YOU will have to move towards to or backward from your subject.

It can be light and dark contrast, or contrast of hues, or contrast in saturation, clarity, focus and so on. \n\nSo when it comes to shooting and processing, ask yourself what you want the subject to be. Then ask yourself how to highlight that with your edit. \n\nSo Taking this as an example, during shooting I would probably get lower, closer and take a step to my right.

I think you probably lightened it to get a soft/milkiness on your body - maybe see if you can keep the effect but also retain the bold darks. \n\n\u2022 The rug in the bottom right and the shadow beneath the chair are distracting and my eyes gravitate there. I'd crop out more of the floor and maybe try cropping some of the bottom chair. It makes a tighter shot that is more focused.\n\n\u2022 Why did you choose to shoot this portrait rather than landscape? I think Landscape might be better served - This image is composed laterally not vertically. The points of interest in this image all rest in the middle third. I'd recommend trying it landscape and zooming in for a tight crop. It would also bring more attention to the sweet shadow that's on that curtain. [I cropped this image to give you an idea but it would be better if you shot it again.](http://i.imgur.com/TuosY.jpg)\n\nAnyway. I usually don't give feedback here.

So, when they see it and know how they were feeling when they took it, it\u2019s captured that feeling in their perception, and it reminds them and/or brings back that/those feelings.

I'm a director/cinematographer so I go for a more filmic feel, which might not be to your style.  So I'll let you know how you can improve this from a pure lighting standpoint - in a stylized way.  At the end I'll let you know what I think you can do if you want it to have a more standardized/professional style.\n\nIt looks like you used two point lighting here!  I'd highly recommend 3 point lighting for this with a large softbox to light up the front of her face (if you're going for clarity).  In this case, you should then keep the light to the left as is, so it gets that same shadow detail - but move the right light waaaay further back to give more of an edge light.  You did an amazing job with skin texture here, and you should lean into that by turning your lights so they're at a wider angle bouncing off the skin.  This will heavily improve texture, especially on the lips.  Some people don't like this, but I think the texture of the human face is one of the best things you can highlight to make your photos unique.  \n\nIf you want a more stylized look, consider moving the fill light a little further around her face so that the eye facing the camera is fairly well lit, and then move the edge light to the same side as the fill - until it's essentially, from left to right - sharp edgelight, soft fill light, partial shadow, then shadow.  You can also highlight her head by putting the edge light way in the back, which creates a super unique look.  If you do that, though, push the light down so it gets her chin as well.  \n\nFor a more standardized look, have massive soft light keeping her face flat, just barely off to the side of the camera - and raise it up.  A lot of good fashion photographers will try and partially simulate cloudy sunlight coming in at roughly a 45 degree angle, and then have their second light around the same height as the subject towards the side to give some edge light.  Some will add a third that is even lower than the second, on the opposite side, to really add umph.  IF you go with flat lighting, you NEED a hair light.  It's an absolute necessity because flat lighting is bad, but a hair light makes it suddenly good to a surprising amount of people. \n\nThis all depends on the model, the feel, and the colors/composition.  It also depends on your preference.  I personally prefer to do composition first, and THEN lighting - but I know this is better for film and more mundane photography where a small change in composition can literally make lighting go from good to bad.  It's something you can only gain with experience, but I hope this helped!", "It works better when one flash is a bit softer than the other.", "You need a reflector. That is not very flattering lighting.", "Most fashion photographers make female skin look too airbrushed for my taste, but this photo takes to too far the other way. The grazing angle of the angle greatly exaggerates shadows of her skin texture, making it look rough. It does distract from her beautiful eyes.", "By \"Flashes\" - I am assuming you mean photo strobes?  Use the right terminology if you are striving to be a professional.  \n\n\nSecond - lighting is an art and it takes a lot of experience to develop a personal style and learn how to paint your subject with light and not simply nuke them with it.  Keep practicing - burn up lots of exposures and try different things.  You have to learn how to work with not just light but shadows as well - when you place a light or a bounce at a certain place - how will it hit the subject?  What shadows will it cast?  How will the quality of the light change as it interacts with different objects like soft boxes, bounces, and gels?\n\nAs for this image, its a bit of a mess.  Thats not surprising for a first try - you should see some of the stuff I hide in my Lightroom catalog.  But lets get specific.  \n\n\nIt appears to me that you used one oblique light to the left of your subject.  Oblique light tends highlight texture.  A good example id gif I am shooting a guy and want to make his torso look super ripped - I will light that to the side so that the abdominals cast wicked shadows.   \n\n\nIf I want to make him look less ripped - I will use a flat light (light placed in front of the subject) to erase any shadows in his cuts.  \n\n\nThe same effect is at work in this image.  The key light being placed to the right significantly ages your subject by making her skin look like sandpaper and enhancing her naso-labial folds.  You added 10 pounds of fat to her face and highlighted every pore in her skin.  Also that ringlet of hair is just messy and distracting - it absolutely does not add any mystery or allure to the photo.  \n\n\nThe shadows on the right side of the face are just muddy  and a mess.  Look at the area around the right eye - she looks puffy and heavy.  If she were a professional model with this image in her port - she would be laughed out of an agency.  \n\n\nFor a shot like this I would typically use a 2 light set-up - or at least a light and a bounce.  I would have the key light directly in front of the subject with a soft box or other diffuser on it and a side light.  I would meter the side light no more than 1/2 stop higher than the key light.  That way I can still have some alluring shadows on the face, but enough fill light to still open the face up.", "You need more light on the eyes: here the eyes are in shade yet below the eyes are lit.

Preferably white-ish lighting, but you can also look for an app that allows you to adjust the 'warmth' of a picture (aka the colour temperature). The reason behind cranking up the lighting is that your camera needs light to make an image, right? Well if the camera doesn't get enough, it needs more time to soak up the light, a longer shutter time. Longer shutter times mean you have to hold still a while longer, and if you don't you get blurry images. \n\nAlso a more technical point, the camera has another tool to adjust the 'exposure' of a photo. It can make it's sensor more sensitive, to make more use of the light it gets. The downside of this is that the quality of the picture gets worse with higher sensitivity, this sensitivity is called 'ISO'. You most likely can't control it, so let's just crank up the light to make the camera's job easier. \n\nWell then, the picture should be a lot better now in terms of sharpness.

I would also see if you can get the ISO lower. It's picky, but there's some noise in the darkest ring that I think would vanish with 400 or lower ISO.

I also turn off any VR or stabilization for long exposures  (I know that sounds counterintuitive but it helps for long exposures).\n\nAt 1 sec, if the girl moves at all or there's any wind, your sharpness is gone.  In this situation, you probably needed an off camera flash on her to make her appear brighter.  But, that can be tricky.\n\nI also agree that you didn't need to be at f/32.  I would lower that so you get back some on the ISO.\n\nThese kinds of shots are more art than science.  They take practice and every situation is different.  \n\nI do like the idea.", "Kudos for trying to think outside the box. Compositionally, if your wife is the subject, she really needs to have something that causes your eye to focus on her in the frame. In this case, the subject of this shot feels like the bright and busy center-frame skyscraper and light trails in the background, and your spouse rather unfortunately feels like someone who you didn't notice was in the frame until after you got home from shooting and were reviewing your photos. So there's a bit of a contradiction in terms and ideas here. I don't think she can (or should) be \"barely noticeable\" while still also being \"the subject\".\n\nIf you want her to be the subject, but don't want to present a ton of detail in her features/etc., you might try exploring composing her in silhouette, which would typically require more effort in lighting the shot artificially. This would allow her to take up the majority of the frame as the item of interest, but still have some mystique associated with her.\n\nYou could also get closer to her environmental portrait-style, but don't have her looking straight down the barrel of the lens. She could be looking off at the building (which is out of focus) while being moodily lit by the street lights. She's still the subject, but it's not a \"hey, look at me\" sort of thing.\n\nAlternatively, if you don't want her to be filling the frame, and want the viewer to have to \"find\" her, you need to eliminate distracting elements in your composition, include elements that lead the eye *toward* her (leading lines, contrast between her and the environment), and she needs to be interesting and somehow stand out in her own right. We need to have a reason to *want* to look at her.\n\nOn the technical side with your settings, I don't think you'd ever want to be shooting *anything* at f/32. Maybe sun-stars? Typically you choose higher f-stops to get more of the frame in sharp focus, often for things like landscapes. The problem is, once you start getting toward the extreme end of things (and f/32 is definitely extreme), you start getting problems with something called diffraction. Basically, your camera aperture is so small relative to the wavelength of incoming light that it causes different colours to fan out and bleed into neighbouring receptors on your camera sensor, resulting in loss of image quality. I think if you find yourself tempted to go above f/16, you need to stop and really question why.\n\nCompounding the above is the fact that choosing a higher f-stop at night is fraught with peril: The higher the f-stop, the smaller the aperture is that allows light in through your lens, and the less light you're capturing overall. But you're already capturing less light given that it's pitch black outside, so you're shooting yourself in the foot right from the start. The only way to compensate at that point is to crank your ISO (introducing more noise in the image, which is already going to be a problem for night shots in the first place), or lower your shutter speed to something inappropriate (making it difficult to capture a sharp image of anything other than something totally inanimate)"], "label": 0, "image": ["2021-photocritique-submission_ngqmy3-image.jpeg"]}, {"text": ["When dealing with \"jittery\" subjects, your best defense is going with a smaller aperture, like F4 - F8.  Smaller apertures give you a deeper depth of  field, which will help keep your subject in focus.
